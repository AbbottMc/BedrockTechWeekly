Do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, beeeeeta! Oh, hello. I was just practicing my scales so that I can harmonise with the new music that was added this week! In fact, I think that even more is in order. While you test out all the new features in this beta and [report all the bugs you can find](http://bugs.mojang.com/), I’m going to pen a ballad about the new deep dark blocks that will be haunting in all senses of the word. As always, we really appreciate all the feedback you send to [aka.ms/CavesCliffsFeedback](http://aka.ms/CavesCliffsFeedback) and please report any bugs you may find at [bugs.mojang.com](http://bugs.mojang.com/).
