## **Item Scripting**

Implemented first past of Item Script Components

-   ItemStack
    -   Exposed interfaces for accessing script-enabled ItemComponents on ItemStack
    -   hasComponent(componentId: string) - returns true if the ItemStack has the component \[componentId\] attached to it
    -   getComponent(componentId: string) - returns a handle to the component attached to this ItemStack. Returns an undefined handle if the component does not exist or if the component is yet to be exposed to script
    -   getComponents() - returns an array of all attached script-enabled components on this ItemStack
-   NumberRange
    -   A class to describe a random value between a min and max number
    -   Property min - the minimum value in the range
    -   Property max - the maximum value in the range
    -   next() - returns a random number between min and max
-   Items Registry
    -   Added Items registry class to get all Items by name
