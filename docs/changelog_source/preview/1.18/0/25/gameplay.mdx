## **World Generation**

-   Frozen biomes no longer generate Ice pillars below Y=0 on worlds with updated chunks ([MCPE-125128](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-125128))
-   Ocean ruins and shipwrecks are now generated in lower frequency ([MCPE-143478](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-143478))

-   Azalea trees can now generate in shallow water
-   Rooted Dirt can no longer generate without an Azalea tree ([MCPE-140867](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-140867))
-   Vanilla Parity: Removed Deep Warm Ocean from biome placement ([MCPE-147051](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-147051))

## **Android**

-   The game has temporarily been reverted from API 30 to API 29. Players with existing external storage will be migrated to the new location on start up. If you manually migrated your external storage, you should not be affected ([MCPE-144801](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-144801), [MCPE-144776](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-144776), [MCPE-144806](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-144806))
-   Players with external storage will be migrated to new location at start up, due to storage changes required by Google. You can still play if migration fails by closing the results window
-   With external storage being migrated to its new location in preparation for Google's new API requirements, you will now lose your data if you uninstall Minecraft, unless you check the box indicating you want to keep your data. We recommend checking this box if you wish to keep your worlds in the event you choose to reinstall Minecraft

## **User Interface**

-   Updated the "out of storage" message
