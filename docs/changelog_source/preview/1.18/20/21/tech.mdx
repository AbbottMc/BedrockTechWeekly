-   A world with "StorageVersion" 8 or lower will be increased to 9 and have its "RandomSeed" upgraded from using only the lower 32 bits of a 64-bit number to using the full 64-bit range while still representing the same number. This is only relevant for negative 32-bit seeds, which need a sign bit extension

## **Additional Modding Capabilities Experiment/JavaScript APIs  
## **

## **Important!** In this release and starting with this beta, we are removing the Additional Modding Capabilities experiment.  This experiment contained experimental JavaScript APIs launched in 2018 – and with this removal, JavaScript within worlds associated with this API will no longer function.  GameTest Framework – a separate JavaScript API – should not be impacted, nor should behavior pack/resource pack type add-ons more broadly. You can read more about this [via this article](https://aka.ms/mcamc).

##  **Commands**

-   Added '/tickingarea' command preload overload
-   Entities must now be loaded for an area to be considered fully loaded and ticking

## **Molang**

-   Molang expressions inside animation scripts for actor resource definition (pre\_animation and initialize) that contain capital letters are properly evaluated now with format\_version 1.18.20 or higher

## **User Interface**

-   The loading progress screen now shows when loading ticking areas marked for preload

## **GameTest Framework**

New Module! We added a **mojang-minecraft-ui** module with API structures for creating simple dialog boxes:
