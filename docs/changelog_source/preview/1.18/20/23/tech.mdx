## **Blocks**

-   Fixed an issue where projectiles would 'bounce' off of Bells in strange ways ([MCPE-47847](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-47847))

## **Commands**

-   The '/tickingarea' command no longer modifies areas from entities with _tick\_world_ component

## **Molang**

-   Fixed Logical AND to evaluate before Logical OR, and for comparison operators to evaluate before equality operators
    -   This is a Molang Versioned Change that only takes effect for Molang expressions in packs that use a min\_engine\_version of 1.18.20 or higher
    -   For example A && B || Cnow evaluates as (A && B) || C and A \< B == C \> D now evalutes as (A \< B) == (C \> D)

## **Structure Generation and Actor Spawning**

-   Fixed duplicate End Crystals spawning on top of End Spikes ([MCPE-147817](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-147817))

## **Experimental**

-   Fixed an issue in which actor properties would not always sync from server to client

## **EatMobGoal**

-   EatMobGoal is now unable to start when the player is the target

## **GameTest Framework**

-   Vector
    -   Added function length(): number- Returns the length of this vector
    -   Added function normalized(): Vector- Returns this as a normalized vector
    -   Added static function distance(a:Vector, b:Vector): number- Returns distance between two vectors
    -   Added static function lerp(a:Vector, b:Vector, t: number): Vector- Returns the linear interpolation between a and b using t as the control
    -   Added static function slerp(a:Vector, b:Vector, s: number): Vector- Returns the spherical linear interpolation between a and b using s as the control
    -   Added static function cross(a:Vector, b:Vector): Vector- Returns the cross product of these two vectors
    -   Added static function add(a:Vector, b:Vector): Vector- Returns the addition of these vectors
    -   Added static function subtract(a:Vector, b:Vector): Vector- Returns the subtraction of these vectors
    -   Added static function multiply(a:Vector, b:Vector): Vector- Returns the component-wise product of these vectors
    -   Added static function divide(a:Vector, b:Vector): Vector- Returns the component-wise division of these vectors
    -   Added static function multiply(a:Vector, b:number): Vector- Returns the product of this vector and a scalar
    -   Added static function divide(a:Vector, b:number): Vector- Returns the division of this vector and a scalar
    -   Added static function min(a:Vector, b:Vector): Vector- Returns a vector that is made from the smallest components of two vectors.
    -   Added static function max(a:Vector, b:Vector): Vector- Returns a vector that is made from the largest components of two vectors
-   World
    -   Added function playSound(soundName: String, soundOptions: SoundOptions): void- plays a sound specified by the sound name, at a location, pitch, or volume as optionally specified in the SoundOptions argument
-   EntityItemComponent
    -   Added component EntityItemComponentthat can be used to obtain an ItemStack from an item entity – e.g., getComponent(“item”).itemStack
