### **WARNING: Opening your worlds in the beta can corrupt chunks!**

## **UPDATE:** This issue has been resolved in version 1.18.30.30/31.

We've identified an issue in the current Beta and Preview version that causes chunks to become corrupted below Y=0. We're working on releasing a new version to prevent this issue from occurring. To avoid corrupted chunks, please refrain from opening your worlds until an update has been released.

Hey! Who turned off the light? And the sound? It’s very dark and very, very quiet in here. Uh-oh. That must mean…no. Already? Well, judging by the glowing sculk blocks around me, the Deep Dark biome has made it into this week’s Beta! Come on down if you dare, there are sculk blocks to study and stealthy sneaking to be snuck. You don’t have to be super careful this time around, since you will truly be alone down here. But prepare yourself, a warden will arrive eventually.

Here's a list of what is new in this week's Beta! As always please search and report any bugs you may find at [bugs.mojang.com](http://bugs.mojang.com/).

# **Experimental Features**

    -   Dimly lit and eerie, the Deep Dark is sure to strike fear into the hearts of even the most brave player
    -   The surfaces of the Deep Dark are covered in Sculk
    -   The only mob that calls the Deep Dark home is the Warden
    -   **Please note:** The Warden hasn’t made its way into the game yet, but it’s getting ready for its big debut!

## **Axes**

-   Vanilla Parity: Attacks with Axes towards a raised Shield will disable the Shield for 5 seconds

## **Copper Horn**

-   We don’t have any additional changes planned for the Copper Horn, but we would love to hear more about what you think of this experimental feature, and how you might use it if it made it into the final update! Send us your feedback here: [aka.ms/MCGoatsFeedback](https://aka.ms/MCGoatsFeedback)
