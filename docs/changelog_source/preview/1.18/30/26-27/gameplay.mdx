Here's a list of what is new in this week's Beta! As always please search and report any bugs you may find at [bugs.mojang.com](http://bugs.mojang.com/).

## **Known Issues**

-   Older worlds that have areas unexplored since before 1.18 may experience issues in those areas with below y=0 not generating correctly. We suggest that you make backup copies of your worlds, and avoid opening pre-1.18 worlds in this Beta/Preview build.

# **Experimental Features**

## **Copper Horn**

-   Added Copper Horn item, which is crafted using three Copper Ingots in a "v shape" with a Goat Horn in the middle
-   Can play three different sounds, by looking up, crouching, and everything else
-   Added special sounds for Copper Horns crafted from Goat Horns found from screaming Goats

## **Goat Horn**

-   Added additional Goat Horn sounds, which are random per goat
-   Added special sounds for Screaming Goat
-   Is always dropped when a Goat with at least one horn rams these blocks: Stone, Packed ice, Iron Ore, Copper Ore, Emerald Ore, or any kind of wood log from the Overworld
-   Can be crafted into Copper Horn using 3 Copper Ingots in a "v shape" with a Goat Horn in the middle
-   Goats have a small chance of spawning with only one horn (Baby Goats will always end up with two horns)

## **Pillager Outpost**

-   Added Goat Horn and Copper Horns as loot
