## **Animation**

-   Fixed a crash that could occur when an animation controller referenced itself as one of its "animations"

## **Commands**

-   The '/spreadplayers' command no longer hangs when given a high spread range ([MCPE-137793](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-137793))
-   Fixed a bug that caused performance drops when using the '/tag' command ([MCPE-139609](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-139609))

## **Data-Driven Entities**

-   Fixed many missing "Description" entries in the documentation
-   Added AI Goals documentation for "behavior.move\_to\_liquid" and "behavior.move\_to\_block"
-   Added AI Goals documentation for missing parameters of "behavior.tempt", "behavior.rise\_to\_liquid\_level", and "behavior.random\_fly"

## **Feature Placement**

-   Optimization of geode feature placement. Reduces the compute cost of geode feature placement

## **Mobs**

-   The "controlling\_seat" field on "minecraft:rideable" now works as intended for both Boats and Horses
-   Mobs riding other mobs and pathing towards a target will no longer wiggle back and forth along their path
-   Match tool conditions now work on mobs (Experimental)

## **Molang**

-   Fixed arrow operator to return 0 if the left side is not a valid entity or item, rather than causing the entire expression to return 0

## **GameTest Framework**

There are some important breaking changes in APIs creators should be aware of:

-   Renamed mojang-minecraft:Worldobject to mojang-minecraft:world (World still exists but is the type instead of the instance of the world)
    -   In practice, this means “World.getDimension” code should now read “world.getDimension”
-   Removed mojang-minecraft:Commands- Instead, we are adding runCommand methods on dimension, entity, and player
    -   In practice, this means that “Commands.run(“say Hello World”, dimension)” should now read “dimension.runCommand(“say Hello World”)”

Many exciting new API adds, as well:

-   mojang-minecraft:ItemStack
    -   Item use events:
        -   Added event World.event.beforeItemUse - Fires before an item is used. Can be cancelled
        -   Added event World.event.itemUse - Fires when an item is used and the before event is not cancelled
        -   Added event World.event.beforeItemUseOn - Fires before an item is used on a block. Can be cancelled
        -   Added event World.event.itemUseOn - Fires when an item is used on a block and the before event is not cancelled
    -   Note that the following definition events only function with data driven items created as part of the Holiday Creator Features experiment:
        -   Added event World.event.beforeItemDefinitionEvent - Fires before an Item definition event is processed. Can be cancelled
        -   Added event World.event.itemDefinitionEvent - Fires when the Item definition event is processed and the before event is not cancelled
        -   Added method triggerEvent(eventName : String) - Triggers an event on the ItemStack if an event with the given eventName, as defined in the Items JSON file
    -   mojang-minecraft:Entity

        -   Added dimensionproperty to get the dimension the entity is in
        -   Added function addTag(tag: string): bool- Adds a tag to this entity. Returns true if the tag does not already exist
        -   Added function hasTag(tag: string): bool- Returns true if the tag exists on this entity
        -   Added function removeTag(tag: string): bool- Removes a tag from this entity. Returns true if the tag was removed
        -   Added function getTags(): string\[\] - Returns all tags on this entity
        -   Added target property to Entity. targetrepresents the Entity that this Entity is currently targeting, for purposes such as AI targeting
        -   Added function getEntitiesFromViewVector(options: EntityRaycastOptions): Entity\[\]\` - Gets all entities that intersects the ray from the entities view vector
        -   Added function getBlockFromViewVector(options: BlockRaycastOptions): Block – Gets the first block that intersects the ray from the entities view vector
    -   mojang-minecraft:Dimension
        -   Added runCommandmethod to run a command in a dimension
        -   Added function getEntitiesFromRay(pos: Location, direction: Location, options: EntityRaycastOptions): Entity\[\]- Gets all entities that intersects the ray starting at a location which extends in direction
        -   Added function getBlockFromRay(pos: Location, direction: Location, options: BlockRaycastOptions) : Block - Gets the first block that intersects the ray starting at a location which extends in direction
    -   mojang-gametest:Test
        -   Added getDimensionto get the dimension in which the test is being ran
    -   mojang-gametest:ScriptSimulatedPlayer
        -   Added function giveItem(itemStack: ItemStack, selectSlot: boolean)
        -   Added function setItem(itemStack: ItemStack, selectSlot: boolean, slot: number)
        -   GameTestExtensions - Removed function giveItem
