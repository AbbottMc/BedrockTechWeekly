## **AI Goals**

- Added "cooldown" field to target descriptors in "minecraft:behavior.nearest_attackable_target" goal

## **Blocks**

- Sponges no longer emit water drop particles underwater ([MCPE-122138](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-122138))

## **Commands**

- For worlds using game version 1.19.80 and above, acquiring a custom spawn egg through a command can only succeed with their full name rather than with an aux value, eg. "/give @s namespace:actor_spawn_egg"
- Removed requirement for blockState argument(s) when using other optional args in /fill /setblock and /clone ([MCPE-167959](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-167959))
- Implemented the "inputpermission" command, which allows for setting the player's camera or movement as enabled or disabled
  - Syntax: /inputpermission set <target: player> <permission: camera | movement> <state: enabled | disabled>
- Implemented the "haspermission" target selector, which allows for selection based on player permission levels

## **General**

- For behavior packs using version 1.19.80 and above, recipes no longer accept a Molang query for the item's data field, instead use the item's full name, eg. use { "item": "namespace:actor_spawn_egg" } instead of { "item": "spawn_egg", "data": "query.get_actor_info_id('namespace:actor')" }
