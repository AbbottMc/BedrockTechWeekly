## **Experimental Features**

### **Armor Trims**

- You can now visually customize your armor with a variety of unique trims at the Smithing Table
- Armor Trims are purely visual with no gameplay benefits, and can only be applied to Helmets, Chestplates, Leggings, and Boots
  - All trim patterns are visually the same on an armor's item icon, but the color will still change based on the trim material
  - To check which trim pattern a piece of armor has, you can hover over it in the inventory
- Armor Trim Smithing Templates can be found all throughout the world, and each of the following structures contain their own unique Smithing Template:
  - Pillager Outpost
    - Sentry Armor Trim
  - Desert Pyramid
    - Dune Armor Trim
  - Shipwreck
    - Coast Armor Trim
  - Jungle Temple
    - Wild Armor Trim

  - Smithing Templates are found in Chests in their respective structure, except for the Ocean Monument. Instead of finding it in Chests, Elder Guardians sometimes drop a Smithing Template when defeated
  - Some Armor Trim Smithing Templates are rarer than others, so be on the lookout for them to impress your friends!
  - An Armor Trim has two properties: a pattern and a material
    - The pattern is defined by the Smithing Template used to apply the trim, and represents the visual pattern of the trim
    - The material is defined by what ingredient you used to apply the trim, and represents the color of the trim
  - The viable ingredients you can use to define the color of your Armor Trim are the following:
    - Iron
    - Copper
    - Gold
    - Lapis
    - Emerald
    - Diamond
    - Netherite
    - Redstone
    - Amethyst
    - Quartz

### **Blocks**

- Frogs born in the Cherry Grove biome are now the temperate variant instead of the cold variant ([MCPE-168083](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-168083))

### **Netherite Equipment**

- Netherite equipment crafting now also requires a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template
- Netherite Upgrade Smithing Templates can be found randomly in all Bastion Remnant chests, and there is a guarantee of 2 in every Treasure Room Bastion Remnant
- This change was made for a variety of reasons:
  - Increases the time players utilize Diamond equipment before Netherite
  - Make Netherite equipment a more significant achievement in the game's progression
  - Adapts Netherite more naturally into the new Smithing Table crafting system

### **Smithing Templates**

- Smithing Tables have been redesigned into a workstation for physical equipment upgrades and modifications
- Alongside slots for combining a piece of equipment and materials, there is now a required slot for an item type called Smithing Templates
- Smithing Templates define what type of upgrade you will be making to equipment
  - It specifies both what type of items you can upgrade, and which ingredients are valid to customize the upgrade
  - There are currently two categories of Smithing Templates: Armor Trim and Netherite Upgrade
- Smithing Templates are consumed when used to upgrade an item in the Smithing Table
- You can craft a copy of a Smithing Template in the Crafting Table with 7 Diamonds + 1 block of material that the template is made out of + 1 Smithing Template, which will output 2 of the same Smithing Template
