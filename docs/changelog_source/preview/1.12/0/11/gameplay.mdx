## **Fixes:**

-   **Crashes/Performance**
    -   Improved FPS performance related to various particles:
        -   Enderman's teleporting particles no longer cause consistent FPS drop, especially during boss fights
        -   Improved performance related to bubble columns, improving FPS during underwater exploration 
-   **General**
    -   Fixed several more issues where the player's skin would revert to a default one if the network connection changed
    -   Skins equipped from the 'Recently used' section are now correctly applied when selected 
    -   Minecoin offers now display correct amount of coins given in offer
-   **Gameplay**
    -   Floating blocks no longer turn grass to dirt at night ([MCPE-46035](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-46035), [MCPE-45751](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-45751), [MCPE-45698](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-45698))
-   **Mobs**

-   V2 zombie villagers now have the correct name in death messages instead of a placeholder name ([MCPE-45932](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-45932))

-   **Commands**
    -   Command selectors are back to resolving in less that 0.5ms as opposed to 4+ms
    -   \`villager\_v2\` works in selectors again, and targets both villager and v2 villagers
