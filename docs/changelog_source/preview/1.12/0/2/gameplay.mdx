## **17 April 2019**

**PLEASE READ before participating in the Minecraft Beta:**

-   Joining the beta will replace your game with a work in progress version of Minecraft
-   You will not have access to Realms and will not be able to join non-beta players while you're previewing the beta
-   Any worlds played while in the beta cannot be opened in previous versions of the game so please make copies of worlds to prevent losing them
-   Beta builds can be unstable and are not representative of final version quality
-   The beta is available only on Xbox One, Windows 10, and Android (Google Play). To join or leave the beta, see aka.ms/JoinMCBeta for detailed instructions

## **Known Issues in this beta that will be fixed in a future update:**

-   Mob head geometry - some mobs such as cats and villagers may have misaligned heads when they are sleeping or sitting ([MCPE-44648](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-44648))
-    Tridents and Shields may appear invisible when being held by the player ([MCPE-44647](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-44647))

## **New Features:**

-   Item instance IDs can now be synchronized between clients and servers
-   Added auto complete to command blocks 
-   Added spawnRadius gamerule
    -   players can specify in their worlds called spawnRadius. The concept was adapted from how Java Edition implemented it. It allows players to specify a number between 0 and 32 to create an allowed area for spawning to take place. So a spawn radius of 27 is a larger circle than a radius of 12. Players then will spawn in a random location in that radius.
-   Enabled content logging on Bedrock Dedicated Server 
-   Added a delay option to command blocks 
    -   A delay can be added to the command block using the new field. The ticks for this delay are Redstone ticks.
