## **Editor**

-   Fixed bug where Editor could be accessed during a regular gameplay session

## **General**

-   Fix "get\_equipped\_item\_name" Molang query not being able to return the old name of some flattened items, eg. red\_wool to wool

## **Entities**

-   Introduced new entity filters "all\_slots\_empty" and "any\_slot\_empty" to allow searching for empty item slots in a designated equipment location ([MCPE-153909](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-153909))

## **Graphical**

-   Fixed a crash when enabling ray tracing in ray tracing compatible content that was loaded into with ray tracing turned off ([MCPE-168894](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-168894))

## **Items**

-   Custom items with 'minecraft:durability' and 'minecraft:repairable' can be combined to repair them without requiring a custom item entry

## **Recipes**

-   Fixed incorrect content warnings for recipes that use the same blocks but with different data ([MCPE-168717](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-168717))

## **Components**

-   Attribute "speed\_multiplier" in the "minecraft:boostable" component is now being parsed correctly from json file. Old behavior is maintained for "format\_version" lower than 1.20 with 1.35 value rather than what the json file specifies ([MCPE-164424](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-164424))

## **Add-Ons**

-   Added "minecraft:facing\_direction" state to the "minecraft:placement\_direction" block trait.
    -   "minecraft:facing\_direction" is a six value integer state (down, up, south, west, north, east)
    -   Can enable and access this state on blocks through the "minecraft:placement\_direction" trait
    -   Can access the "minecraft:cardinal\_direction" state on blocks that apply the "minecraft:placement\_direction" trait in block\_property Molang queries and set\_block\_property EventResponses
-   Pumpkin blocks use state "minecraft:cardinal\_direction" instead of "direction"
