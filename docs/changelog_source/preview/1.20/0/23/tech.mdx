<Switcher techSapi={<TechSapiExp/>} techSapiDiff={undefined}/>

## **Items**

-   Items with the ‘minecraft:throwable’ component now trigger the ‘throw’ sound effect when used

## **Scripting**

-   After Events
    -   All non-before events have been moved from world.events to world.afterEvents
    -   events has been removed from the world object
    -   After events do not execute immediately, instead they are deferred until a later point in the tick when they are flushed. It is guaranteed that all events fired in a tick are flushed within a tick
