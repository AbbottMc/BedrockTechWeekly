In this week’s Bedrock Preview and Beta we’re bringing you three things I am _particularly_ excited about. Grudge-bearing armadillos! (Now they’ll _remember_ who hit them last and view that player as a threat.)  Breeze vs. iron golem battles! (The one we’ve all been waiting for) And finally a brand new block: the vault! The vault is especially exciting for those who like playing multiplayer, as it makes it far more rewarding for everyone in your party – literally. That’s because the vault (unlike chests) can be unlocked and looted by multiple players (although _only once per player_). So no more crying over empty chests! Now you only need to cry if you accidentally hit an armadillo – because they’ll remember. For 10 whole seconds!

Here’s a list of what’s new. As always, we love to hear your feedback, so please let us know what you think [here](https://aka.ms/mcvaultsfeedback), and report any bugs you may encounter at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/).

# Experimental Features

## Vault

-   A block that holds locked treasure and loot - find the right key to eject its rewards
    -   Found throughout Trial Chambers, containing the structures' most valuable loot
    -   Vaults in Trial Chambers require a Trial Key to be unlocked
-   Can be unlocked by an unlimited amount of players
    -   After a player has unlocked a Vault, they cannot unlock that Vault again
    -   If a player has not unlocked that Vault before, an orange stream of particles will flow from the player to the Vault when nearby
-   Has a keyhole that will be open or closed depending on the players nearby
    -   If any nearby player has not unlocked that Vault, the keyhole will be open
    -   If all nearby players have unlocked that Vault, the keyhole will be closed
-   Within its cage, it will cycle through and display items which are possible to eject from its loot table
-   The rewards it ejects are randomized from its loot table each time it is unlocked
-   Vaults currently reuse the same loot table that reward chests previously used in the Trial Chambers
    -   This loot table is temporary and will be completely revised as development continues
-   Cannot be crafted or obtained in Survival mode, and does not drop anything when mined
-   Explosion-resistant and cannot be moved

## Armadillo

-   All sounds emitted by Armadillos are now audible even when the player is facing away 
    -   Armadillos now keeps track of the last player who hit them, regarding them as a threat for 10 seconds
-   Hurt sounds emitted by rolled-up Armadillos have been updated 

## Breeze

-   Breeze is now aggressive toward Iron Golems, in addition to players
-   Breeze no longer retaliates against attacks from the following mobs: Skeletons, Strays, Zombies, Husks, Spiders, Cave Spiders, and Slimes
    -   The above mobs don't retaliate when hurt by the Breeze's Wind Charge projectile
-   Fixed the Breeze's run particles to pick up particle color/texture from Leaf blocks if that's the block immediately below the Breeze

# Features and Bug Fixes

## Commands

-   Added "has\_property" filter for entity target selector that allows for targeting based on the type and value of properties
-   The /damage command no longer contains the damage type 'suicide'. It is replaced with 'self\_destruct' ([MCPE-174865](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-174865))

## Items

-   In Realms, attempting destruction of one Sea Turtle Egg on a stack of more than one in Creative no longer destroys two at once ([REALMS-10477](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/REALMS-10477))
-   Spawn Eggs are now called "\[Mob\] Spawn Egg" instead of "Spawns \[Mob\]" so that players can more easily search for them in the Creative inventory
