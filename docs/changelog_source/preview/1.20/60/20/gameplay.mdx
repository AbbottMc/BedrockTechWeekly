What do trial chambers, trial spawners, and the breeze all have in common? As well as all being features of the 1.21 update, they’re all coming to testing for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Beta and Preview _today_! As a lover of chaos and an avid explorer of the unexplored, I can’t wait to _leap_ into this preview and see who can jump the furthest, me (no elytra allowed) or the breeze: a mischievous hostile mob which attacks using the power of wind! Venture down sprawling copper-bulb filled corridors, step through doorways into the unknown, and test yourself (pun intended!) against the trial spawner, a cunning device which spews out a number of mobs based on the size of your party. As always, we’d love your feedback on these features, so please send us your thoughts [here](https://aka.ms/Minecraft121Feedback) and report any bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/)!

# Experimental Features

## Added Breeze mob

-   The Breeze is a cunning, hostile mob that can spawn via Trial Spawner in some rooms within the Trial Chambers
-   The Breeze moves primarily by leaping around the target, sometimes jumping quite long distances
-   An aggressive adversary, the Breeze shoots volatile wind energy in the form of wind charge projectiles at its target
-   Wind charges deal a small amount of damage when colliding directly with an entity
-   After colliding with an entity or a block, wind charge projectiles produce a wind burst, which knocks back entities in the area by several blocks
-   Wind bursts also have the effect of 'activating' certain blocks:

-   Non-Iron Doors and Trapdoors are flipped
-   Fence Gates are flipped
-   Buttons are pressed
-   Levers are flipped
-   Bells are rung and swung
-   Lit Candles (both standalone and on cake) are extinguished

-   Wind bursts do not have any effect on Iron Doors, Iron Trapdoors, or any block being held in its position by a Redstone signal

## Known Parity Breaks

-   Breeze does not have any non-jump movement during combat
-   Breeze does not deflect projectiles
-   Breeze does not avoid trapdoors

## Trial Spawner

-   Trial Spawner is a new variant of Monster Spawners that ejects rewards upon completion and can have variable levels of challenge in multiplayer
-   The challenge level will increase for each new player a Trial Spawner notices nearby

-   Challenge level will not decrease until it is reset during a Trial Spawner's cooldown

-   Unlike normal spawners, a Trial Spawner will spawn a limited number of mobs proportional to its current challenge level

-   It can only spawn a mob at positions that are within line of sight
-   It can spawn a mob regardless of any light level requirement the mob has
-   Spawned mobs are persistent

-   Once all mobs are defeated, the Trial Spawner will eject a set of rewards proportional to the current challenge level

-   After the rewards have been ejected, the Trial Spawner goes into cooldown for 30 minutes during which it will no longer spawn mobs

-   Trial Spawners cannot be crafted nor obtained by players in Survival - instead, they can be found naturally placed throughout Trial Chambers
-   Trial Spawners are extremely slow to mine and resistant to explosions, and will not drop even with Silk Touch
-   When placed in Creative, Trial Spawners have no mob type set by default

-   The mob type can be set by interacting with it while holding a Spawn Egg

-   Creative and Spectator players cannot be detected or noticed by Trial Spawners

## Trial Chambers

-   Trial Chambers are a new structure in the Overworld where players can explore and take on combat challenges during the mid-game

-   Trial Chambers are made out of a variety of Copper and Tuff blocks and can be found in different sizes from large to small
-   Trial Chambers are a relatively common find throughout the Deepslate layer of the underground

-   The layout of each Trial Chamber is procedurally generated, and can include traps, reward chests and a variety of combat spaces

-   Supply chests can be found between different rooms, and give you blocks and items which help you navigate your trials
-   Reward chests are guarded by challenges in each room, and can be a source of enchanted books and equipment
-   The loot found in reward chests are still being iterated, and are absolutely not final

-   Each Trial Chamber will include Trial Spawners with a melee, small melee, or ranged category:

-   Melee

-   Zombie
-   Husk
-   Slime

-   Small Melee

-   Spider
-   Cave Spider
-   Baby Zombie
-   Silverfish

-   Ranged

-   Skeleton
-   Stray

-   Each Trial Spawner category will only use one mob for the entire structure when generated, and these mobs are randomized for each Trial Chamber

-   For example, one Trial Chamber might only spawn Zombies, Cave Spiders and Strays, while another might only spawn Slimes, Silverfish and Skeletons
-   The exceptions to this are some Trial Spawners in unique rooms which always spawn Breezes

## Known issues

-   The corridors sometimes end with a dead end
-   Aquifers, Lush Caves, and Sculk Veins sometimes intersect with the Trial Chamber
-   Loot tables can contain wrong items or wrong quantities of items

## Trial Key

-   An item that can only be obtained from Trial Spawners
-   Trial Keys do not currently have any functionality

## Crafter

-   Updated Crafter textures

## Tuff Bricks

-   Updated Tuff Bricks texture
