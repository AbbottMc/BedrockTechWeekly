I love adventuring in Minecraft. Exploring biomes! Mining stuff! I reckon my pet wolf would love it too, but I’m much too much of an overprotective digital dog parent to let them outside the base. Until today! Because not only is the armadillo coming to pre-release versions of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Preview and Beta (check out its adorable rolling up animation!) but wolf armor is coming, too. Meet the first iteration of the cautious armadillo, a neutral, savanna-dwelling mob that loves spider’s eyes, and rolls up whenever it feels threatened. Armadillos also drop a scute that can be used to craft wolf armor, which currently gives your four-legged friend roughly as much protection as diamond horse armor. Snazzy _and_ safer! As always, we’d love your feedback on the armadillo and wolf armor, so please let us know what you think [here](https://aka.ms/MinecraftArmadilloFeedback), and report any bugs (spider’s eyes not included) at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/). Now if you’ll excuse me, me and my furry friend are off to test the limits of how worried I can be about a cute collection of pixels!

# Experimental Features

## Armadillo

-   Added the Armadillo
-   The Armadillo is a neutral mob
-   Drops Armadillo Scutes periodically
-   Drops Armadillo Scutes when brushed
-   Spawns in Savannas
-   Favorite food is Spider Eyes
-   When an Armadillo detects a threat, it rolls up
    -   Threats are:
        -   Players who are sprinting
        -   Players on a mount or in a vehicle
        -   Undead mobs
    -   It does not roll up if it is fleeing, in water, in the air, or if being led
    -   When an Armadillo is rolled up it does not walk, cannot eat, and will not be tempted by food
    -   It continues to scan for threats, and if there are no threats detected for 3 seconds, it will unroll

## Armadillo Scutes

-   Can be used to craft Wolf Armor
-   Dropped by Armadillos
-   Dispensers can be used to brush Armadillo Scutes off Armadillos

## Wolf Armor

-   Using Wolf Armor on an adult tamed Wolf will equip the armor on the Wolf
    -   Only a Wolf's owner can put Wolf Armor on their tamed Wolf, and with this in mind, Dispensers cannot put Wolf Armor on Wolves
-   Using Shears on a Wolf that is wearing armor will make it drop the armor
    -   Only a Wolf's owner can shear a Wolf Armor from it, and with this in mind, Dispensers cannot remove Wolf Armor from Wolves
-   Wolf Armor gives the same protection as Diamond Horse Armor
-   If a Wolf dies while wearing armor, it will drop the armor

## Blocks

-   Exposed, Weathered, and Oxidized Copper Bulbs in Trial Chambers are now waxed ([MCPE-176949](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-176949))
-   Trial Spawner randomizes the loot table only once each combat, for all players

## Copper Grate

-   Fixed an issue with Waxed Copper Grate transparency ([MCPE-177171](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-177171))

## Breeze

-   Breeze wind and wind charge rendering have been tweaked

## Commands

-   Added a new command that will hide and reset HUD elements visibility.
    -   /hud hide \<hud element\>
    -   /hud reset \<hud element\>

The HUD elements available are:

-   paperdoll
-   armor
-   tooltips
-   touch\_controls
-   crosshair
-   hotbar
-   health
-   progress\_bar
-   hunger
-   air\_bubbles
-   horse\_health
-   all
-   To use the command, turn on the Upcoming Creator Features toggle.

## Updated Edit World Screen

The latest Bedrock Preview introduces a new way of editing your worlds in a new redesigned experience. Some features are not supported yet, but we wanted to give you an early look at what we’re building. An updated Edit World experience will gradually be rolled out to players starting today.

![edit_world_sharp.png](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/22310475920269)

Changes: Edit World is being updated with improved navigation, more descriptions, and a new look and feel that matches the new Create New World Screen. It’ll be rolled out gradually across Android, iOS, Windows, and Xbox in the following days. We’re still working on some things, like support for other platforms, and some minor bugs and improvements. We need some more time to work on these features in order to provide the best possible experience. We would love to hear what you think! Share your feedback on the Feedback Site and put “Edit World” in the title so we can find it.

## Realms

    -   Realms Stories features include:

        -   The Timeline – lets you see when other members are playing on the Realm
        -   The Members tab – shows a list of all Realm members and their permission levels
    -   Please note that Realms Stories will not be accessible the first time you launch 1.20.60.23. To use Realms Stories, launch the game, close it, and then launch it again.

        -   Notifying owners about stories/comments doesn't work
        -   Clicking the 'Manage Members' button as a Realm owner can result in a hang
        -   Comments may not always appear properly
        -   Screen-reader narration isn't finished
        -   Realm members don't see themselves in the Members tab
