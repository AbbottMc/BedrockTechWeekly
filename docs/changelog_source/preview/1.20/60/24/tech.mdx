## AI Goals

-   "behavior.follow\_parent" now interrupts navigation on stop for content using engine version 1.20.60 or higher 

## Biomes

-   Biome tags in JSON files are now specified under a "minecraft:tags" component, in a "tags" array, rather than as loose JSON objects, for files with a format\_version of 1.20.60 or higher 

## Components

-   The "interact" component now supports the additional "entity\_act" value for the "vibration" field

## Editor

The Editor and its corresponding API are in early development, and available for keyboard/mouse on Windows PC Bedrock Preview builds. Tag us on social channels with **#BedrockEditor.**

Learn [how to use](https://aka.ms/LearnEditor) the Editor, join the [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor/discussions) discussion forum to engage with the team, and get started building extensions via the [starter kit](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor-extension-starter-kit) and [samples](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor-extension-samples).
