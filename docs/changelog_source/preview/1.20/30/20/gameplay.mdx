To your minecarts! We hope you’re having a _diamond_ of a summer, whether you’ve spent it mining, wandering, or curled up with an enchanted book! We’ve spent ours experimenting, and this week we want your **feedback on our newest tweaks to diamond ore distribution** and **villager trading.** Does that wandering trader suddenly have more items to sell? Are there more diamonds at the deepslate level? And what did I do during my summer holidays? Discover the answers to at least two of these questions (and a few more) by activating Experiments in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. We really want to hear your thoughts on these tweaks, so please **send your feedback and ideas** to [aka.ms/MC120Feedback](http://aka.ms/MC120Feedback) and report any bugs to [bugs.mojang.com](http://bugs.mojang.com/).

### **Known Issues**

-   We have a known issue in this Beta Preview which may cause a crash when using the search bar within the Marketplace. We are working on a fix for this and hope to have it addressed as soon as possible, thank you for your patience!

## **Experimental Trade Changes**

-   This Preview includes experimental changes to the Wandering Trader and Librarian Villager trades. You must turn on this experiment in the Experiments Menu if you want to test the new trades. Please send us your feedback on these changes at [aka.ms/VillagerTradingFeedback](https://aka.ms/VillagerTradingFeedback)

## **Librarian**

-   Before these changes, players could get any Village enchantment from any Librarian. A novice Librarian could sell the best enchantment in the game! For some players, this felt too random and made trading feel overpowered when compared to using the Enchanting Table or searching for Enchanted Books in structures.
-   With the new rules, Librarians from different biomes sell different enchantments. Master Librarians are guaranteed to have a special enchantment which is different in each Village biome.
-   Players will have to work towards getting the best trades instead of relying on random chance. We hope this makes Librarian trading more interesting and skilful, while also revealing some clues about their history of each Village type through the enchantments that are sold there.

![Librarians in each biome have a special book which is guaranteed from every Master Librarian, and a range of normal books. The special book is listed first. Desert: Efficiency, Fire Protection, Thorns, Infinity. Jungle: Unbreaking, Feather Falling, Projectile Protection, Power. Plains: Protection, Punch, Smite, Bane Of Arthropods. Savanna: Sharpness, Knockback, Binding Curse, (and in Java Edition) Sweeping Edge. Snow: Silk Touch, Aqua Affinity, Looting, Frost Walker. Swamp: Mending, Depth Strider, Respiration, Vanishing Curse. Taiga: Fortune, Blast Protection, Fire Aspect, Flame.](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/18194001593357)

-   Librarians from different biomes now sell different Enchanted Books
-   Master Librarians with full XP are guaranteed to sell a special enchantment, which is different in each Village biome
-   This means that players must visit all seven Village biomes to get the full set of Villager enchantments
-   There are two secret Village biomes where Villages do not generate
    -   A player must build these Villages to access their trades!
-   Some enchantments have been removed from Village trading and must be found in other ways

## **Wandering Trader**

-   Some players felt that the Wandering Trader had unfair prices and didn't sell many useful items. We have lowered their prices, added more trades, and increased the amounts available. The Wandering Trader will also now buy useful items from players, so it's possible to help them on their journey by giving them supplies even if you don't feel like buying anything.
-   As this is an experiment, we would really appreciate your feedback as work continues and to help us decide on the future direction for Villager trades!

![The Wandering Trader now has a chance of buying these items: Water Bottle, Water Bucket, Milk Bucket, Fermented Spider Eye, Baked Potato, Hay Bale. The Wandering Trader now has a chance of selling these items: Logs (of any type), Iron Pickaxe (enchanted), Potion of Invisibility. The prices and amounts of the existing trades have also been adjusted.](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/18193957786125)

-   Wandering Traders now have lower prices and have a higher amount of each item in stock
-   Wandering Traders now sell Logs
-   Wandering Traders can now buy many items, instead of only selling

# **Features and Bug Fixes**
