**Update on 1.20.20**  
Thank you to all who participated in the 1.20.20.xx Minecraft Preview and Betas! We have a lot of exciting fixes and features prepared, but aren't quite ready to release these to everyone just yet. So, we are continuing with the 1.20.30.xx Preview and Betas, and when we are ready we'll have a combined update that is slightly larger than usual.

# **Features and Bug Fixes**

## **Updated Play Screen**

## **![A screenshot of the updated Play screens in Minecraft](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/18619725686029)**

-   The Play screen is being updated with improved navigation, responsive worlds components, and a new look and feel.
-   The Friends tab and Realms tab are now separated, for clearer feature separation
-   The Create New World flow and Create From Template flow are also separated for a clearer path into the game
-   The work on the Play screen is still in progress since a couple of features are missing, but we would love to hear your feedback at [aka.ms/MinecraftPlayScreens](https://aka.ms/MinecraftPlayScreens)

## **Blocks**

-   Calibrated Sculk Sensor's amethyst crystal now lights up alongside the rest of the block during its active phase ([MCPE-168813](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-168813)) ([MCPE-169953](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-169953))
-   Hanging Signs placed with commands now have the proper hitbox ([MCPE-163456](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-163456))
-   "stained\_hardened\_clay" block is now split into unique instances, namely "white\_terracotta", "orange\_terracotta", "magenta\_terracotta", "light\_blue\_terracotta", "yellow\_terracotta", "lime\_terracotta", "pink\_terracotta", "gray\_terracotta", "light\_gray\_terracotta", "cyan\_terracotta", "purple\_terracotta", "blue\_terracotta", "brown\_terracotta", "green\_terracotta", "red\_terracotta", and "black\_terracotta"
    -   Commands will still work with "stained\_hardened\_clay", but "stained\_hardened\_clay" won't be suggested in the command prompt, rather the new names will
-   Third person camera no longer phases through the lower part of Composter ([MCPE-171213](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-171213)) 

## **Stability and Performance**

-   Fixed a Bedrock Dedicated Servers memory leak while loading chunks ([BDS-17527](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/BDS-17527)) 

## **User Interface**

-   Fixed ZL/ZR icons for Joy-Con and Switch Pro controller on Android
-   Caret can be re-positioned in textfield by taps or mouse clicks ([MCPE-131572](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-131572))
-   The “Pause menu” has been renamed to “Game menu” in the user interface
-   Fixed layering issue causing the underground vignette effect to draw on top of all other HUD elements ([MCPE-159217](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-159217))

## **Text-To-Speech**

-   Text-to-speech narrator will now read out the instruction text as well as the confirm button in the Safe Area menu 

## **Commands**

-   Blocks that had an alias prior to being flattened can now be properly referenced in commands 

## **Game rules**

-   Changed "recipes unlock" game rule to be enabled by default. This means that recipe unlocking will be enabled by default when creating a new world but it can still be toggled off in the Advanced Settings. Existing worlds are not affected by this change. 

## **Gameplay**

-   Crossbow loses durability when shooting, not when drawn ([MCPE-46490](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-46490))
