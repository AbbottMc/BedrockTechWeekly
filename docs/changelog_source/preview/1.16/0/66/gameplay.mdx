# Fixes

## **Performance and Stability**

-   Fixed several crashes that could occur during gameplay
-   Fixed a crash that could occur when attempting to create world with the Tropical City Resort mash-up pack
-   Fixed an issue that could cause a delay on start up when trying to open certain worlds

## **General**

-   Fixed an issue with projectiles being destroyed prematurely if they didn't deal damage. This is now optional with the addition of 2 new flags to the projectile 

## **Gameplay**

-   Fixed an issue that could cause chests to generate without loot [MCPE-69003](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-69003) 

## **Graphical**

-   Fixed rendering issues while riding a mount

## **Add-Ons and Scripting**

-   Fixed an issue that could occur when the movement component is removed, meaning that a mob's speed has to ramp up from 0 again
-   Changes to components: _set\_last\_hurt\_requires\_damage_ and _destroy\_on\_hit\_requires\_damage_. Each defaulting to true to respect old behavior, but can now be set to false if it is desired to have a projectile that is destroyed even when it doesn't deal damage

## **Commands**

-   Added new overload for /replaceitem with an option for destroy (the old behavior) or keep (the command will return an error if an item occupies that slot)
-   Fixed a bug where a mob wouldn't delete its goal if all goals were trying to be removed
-   Fixed spamming of particles, sounds, and events for looped, non-zero-length animations with timelines
-   Fixed a syntax error issue when running the /xp command with levels
-   Fixed an issue with “A Nightmare in Candyland” map which was no longer teleporting players correctly
