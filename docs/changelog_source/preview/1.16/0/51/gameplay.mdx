## **Target Block (experimental)**

Because let's face it, your aim could use some practice

-   You will need one hay block and four redstone for this recipe
-   Added to experimental gameplay until it acts consistently over all platforms

# **Mobs**

## **Piglins**

-   Piglins are an aggressive civilization that live in the nether
-   They mostly hang around in the crimson forest, but you might find some in the nether wastes too
-   They think of players as target practice and will attack on sight
-   However if you dress appropriately they will see you as a respectable figure, or tolerable at least
-   Piglins are suspicious of strangers and if they see you opening a chest, or mining a block of gold, they will assume that you're stealing and will treat you accordingly
-   Piglins LOVE gold and get very distracted by gold items
-   Gold ingots are currency to Piglins and you can throw ingots at them or right-click them with an ingot to barter for various goods
-   Piglins sometimes get hungry and hunt Hoglins for food. Or they try at least. They results... vary
-   Piglins prefer to hunt and fight in groups, and when a fight is happening everyone wants in
-   Piglins that somehow end up in the overworld become zombified fairly quickly
-   Piglins are creeped out by soul fire and zombified Piglins, and will stay clear whenever possible
-   Wither skeletons are a historic enemy and Piglins will attack on sight
-   Baby Piglins are not as dangerous

## **Hoglins**

-   Hoglins are big aggressive beasts that live in crimson forests in the nether
-   They attack players on sight, so be careful, they can easily knock you off a ledge!
-   Hoglins drop pork chops, but not willingly
-   You can breed Hoglins by feeding them crimson fungi, but do so at your own risk
-   Hoglins get hunted by Piglins sometimes, but they don't go down without a fight!
-   Despite this, Hoglins and Piglin aren't enemies - they are more like an ecosystem
-   Baby Hoglins like to pretend they are tough - but don't worry, they are more like angry puppies with no teeth
-   Want to keep Hoglins off your back? Pro tip: Hoglins hate the smell of warped fungi!

## **Zombified Piglins**

-   Zombie pigmen are now known as Zombified Piglins, and they now have ears... well, at least one ear

## **Netherite**

-   A new high-level material found in the Nether. Use it to upgrade your diamond gear!

## **Netherite effects**

-   Netherite items float in lava. So you don't lose all your gear after that unplanned lava bath
-   Netherite items have higher enchantment value than diamond (but not as high as gold)
-   Netherite tools work faster and last longer than diamond
-   Netherite weapons do more damage than diamond
-   Netherite armor have higher toughness and durability than diamond
-   Netherite armor gives you knockback resistance, so you barely get knocked back at all when hit by arrows and such
-   Netherite blocks can be used as the base of a beacon and Netherite ingots can be used as the fuel for a beacon. Weird flex but ok
-   And it looks cool!

## **How to make Netherite**

-   Mine Ancient Debris in the lower depths of the Nether. At own risk. No insurance coverage for that
-   Combine 4 Netherite Scrap with 4 Gold Ingots in a crafting table (for now) to make a Netherite Ingot
-   Refine it into Netherite Scrap in a furnace or blast furnace
