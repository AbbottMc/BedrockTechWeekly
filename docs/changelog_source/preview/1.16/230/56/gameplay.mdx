In this week's beta, we are introducing new cave generation along with improved ore generation and mineshafts for the Caves and Cliffs update. We have also fixed some important stability bugs! You can still test out the exciting new Caves and Cliffs features by enabling the Caves and Cliffs experimental toggle on your worlds (You can find out more about using the toggles at [aka.ms/MCExperimentalToggle](https://aka.ms/MCExperimentalToggle)). You can leave us your feedback for these features in the threads at [aka.ms/CavesCliffsFeedback](https://aka.ms/CavesCliffsFeedback), and search and reports any new bugs you may encounter at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/).

## **Caves & Cliffs**

-   Improved visibility when swimming in underwater caves
-   Changed ore generation to match the new world height, and to add more strategy to mining
-   Introducing noise based caved generation that enables caves of more varied sizes and shapes
-   Bringing local water levels to caves, allowing each cave to have its own water level
-   Adapting mineshafts to fit into large caves. Mineshaft corridor is now attached to the ceiling via chains or to the floor via wood columns when missing support platform
