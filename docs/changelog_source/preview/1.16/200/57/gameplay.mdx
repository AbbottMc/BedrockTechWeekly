## Bug Fixes

## **Performance and Stability** 

-   Improved terrain building speed when flying with Elytra ([MCPE-85614](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-85614))  
-   Fixed a bug that would crash the game when using the crafting table on Creative mode  
-   Fixed an issue with a runaway block ticking queue that occurred on a looping data-driven block that changed itself to a different permutation. The bug could cause memory issues, increase load and save times, as well as stalling the game periodically 

## **Technical Changes**  

-   Reduced content warning spam with data\-driven block geometry  
-   A fix for dedicated server that copies the experimental toggle state to LevelSettings while initializing the server instance to make sure it uses the values specified in the loading world 
-   Fixed data\-driven blocks to shrink UVs the same was as actors to prevent UV bleeding
