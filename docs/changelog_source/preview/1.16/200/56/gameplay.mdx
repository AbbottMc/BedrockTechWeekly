## Bug Fixes

## **Vanilla Parity** 

-   Basalt can no longer be destroyed by Ghast fireballs ([MCPE-75252](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-75252))

## **General** 

-   The Founder's Cape will now show up within the capes tab of the dressing room again if owned by user 
-   Fixed a server/client desync with blocks when using the '/fill' command at the edge of render distance  
-   If available GPU memory cannot be queried, the maximum render chunk distance will now default to 16  
-   Fixed an issue that caused a crash on Nintendo Switch when trying to load a 256x resolution resource pack

## **Technical Changes**
