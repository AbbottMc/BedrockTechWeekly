We are very excited to give you a sneak-peek into some upcoming Caves and Cliffs features in this week's Bedrock beta!

We'd love to know what you think, so please send us your feedback at [aka.ms/CavesCliffsFeedback](https://aka.ms/CavesCliffsFeedback) - where will be adding new topics later on as we start to test new features ready for the future Caves and Cliffs release. As always, we'd really appreciate it if you could search for and report any bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/) too - thanks!

# New Features:

### **New Experimental Features**

In this beta we will be starting to use the new Experimental Features toggles to test out some new features!

These options allow us to show you what we're working on for big updates in the future! Please keep in mind though, that some of these Experimental features may not be available in the non-beta releases until we're ready to release the full update in the future.

Please also be aware that using Experimental features means that your worlds will be likely incompatible with other betas in the future, so make sure you keep backup copies of your worlds.

### **Goats!**

We are excited to introduce the first _Caves and Cliffs_ feature in this week's beta - The Goat! Goats will be behind a new Experimental Features Toggle - you will need to enable this to be able to test them out.

-   They love to jump - usually when you’re least expecting it!
-   Beware! They are mischievous and might knock intruders off the mountainside!
-   Goats may drop a horn item if they ram into a tree

### **Powder Snow!**

    -   This block is currently only available through the creative inventory
-   Leather boots make it easier for players to traverse powder snow
-   Entities can enter powder snow blocks, but their movement is slowed down while inside, and fall damage is ignored
-   Goats are smart enough to avoid powder snow blocks when pathing
-   Powder Snow blocks have a slightly different texture than regular snow blocks
-   When the camera is inside a powder snow block fog is rendered around it and an overlay texture is rendered on it
