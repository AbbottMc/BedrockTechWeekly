## **New Features**

-   Piglin Brutes are stronger versions of Piglins that live in bastion remnants and protect the treasures there
-   Unlike their cowardly and greedy counterparts, the Piglin Brutes cannot be distracted by gold and aren't afraid of anything
-   Piglin Brutes attack players on sight, no matter how the player is dressed
-   Piglin Brutes wield axes and don't need any armor, because they're just that tough!
