## **Technical changes**

## **Actors**

-   The "minecraft:behavior.controlled\_by\_player" goal is now data-driven
-   Physics Component's has\_gravity is now used to decide whether a mob should apply water gravity, if the mob does not have a Navigation Component 
-   Ender Crystals can no longer be pushed 
-   The Squid's rendering is now data-driven
-   Mine carts are now data-driven. This converted minecart rideable, minecarts with chest, with hopper, with command block, and with TNT to be data-driven

## **Display Name Component**

-   Items can now override their display name with a localized 'value'. If a value is not supplied the component will stay with its default name. If the value supplied is not in the localization file the display name will be the value string

## **Item Parsing**

-   **Example 1**
    -   **any\_tag functionality added to several actor components. In addition to representing items as item names in json they can now be represented as a set of tags**
    -   "item": \{"any\_tag": "food"\}
    -   "item": \{"any\_tag": \["food", "wood"\]\}
    -   "bribe\_items": \["emerald", \{"any\_tag": "stone"\}\]
    -   minecraft:ageable feed\_items can now use any\_tag functionality
    -   minecraft:breedable breed\_items can now use any\_tag functionality
    -   minecraft:bribeable bribe\_items can now use any\_tag functionality
    -   minecraft:giveable items can now use any\_tag functionality
    -   minecraft:healable items can now use any\_tag functionality
    -   minecraft:tamemount feed\_items and auto\_reject\_items can now use any\_tag functionality
    -   minecraft:equippable accepted\_items can now use any\_tag functionality
-   **Example 2**
    -   **looks for "apple" key in the vanilla localization for a string to use as the display text, which it will NOT find a value so the display name will just be "apple"**
    -   "minecraft:display\_name": \{  
        "value": "apple"  
        \}
-   **Example 3**
    -   **looks for "item.apple.name" key in the vanilla localization for a string to use as the display text, which it will find a value as "Apple". Note "minecraft:" namespace not required.**
    -   "minecraft:display\_name": \{  
        "value": "item.apple.name"  
        \}
-   **Example 4**
    -   **looks for a custom string supplied in the resource pack, if not found the display name will be "item.my\_namespace:My\_Awesome\_Item.name".**
    -   "minecraft:display\_name": \{  
        "value": "item.my\_namespace:My\_Awesome\_Item.name"  
        \}
