        -   The Supply of trades is only restored when the Villager is given the opportunity to work at their Work Station. (This feature is not complete in this beta, but villagers can access a resupply using the command /resupply)
        -   When the Villager's trades are restored to full, it takes whatever Supply was used up (number of trades), and converts that into a price increase called Demand. Demand goes up by the number of Supply used, and down by the number of Supply not used
        -   When villagers make trades, they gain experience. When they gain enough experience, they level up. Levelling up unlocks new trades, which are locked until the Villager is at the appropriate level (currently one trade equals one level up, this will be changed in a future update)
