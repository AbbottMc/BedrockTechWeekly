## Experimental Features

### Amethysts and Geodes

-   Amethyst Geodes have been added to the game!

-   These huge geodes can be found anywhere underground in the Overworld
-   Amethyst geodes have an outer layer of a new block called Smooth Basalt
-   Amethyst geodes have a second layer of another new block called Calcite
-   Amethyst geodes have an inner layer of various Amethyst blocks

-   Calcite, Tuff, and Smooth Basalt have been added to the game!

-   Just smelt basalt to obtain smooth basalt!

-   Amethyst Clusters have been added to the game!

-   Amethyst Clusters grow from Budding Amethyst, which can be found inside geodes
-   Clusters have four growth stages: Small Amethyst Bud, Medium Amethyst Bud, Large Amethyst Bud, and Amethyst Cluster
-   Clusters can only grow when they are placed on Budding Amethyst blocks
-   Fully-grown Amethyst Clusters drop four Amethyst Shards (or more with Fortune) when an Iron Pickaxe or higher is used, and otherwise drop nothing when broken
-   Clusters can be Silk Touched at any stage

-   Budding Amethyst has been added to the game!

-   On any side of a Budding Amethyst block where there is air or a water source block, a Small Amethyst Bud will eventually grow
-   Amethyst Buds can only grow when attached to Budding Amethyst, and will grow until they become Amethyst

-   Clusters Amethyst Blocks have been added to the game!

-   Amethyst comes in block form inside the geodes in two ways: Block of Amethyst and Budding Amethyst
-   All types of Amethyst blocks (clusters included) create beautiful sounds when you walk on them, break them, place them, or hit them with a projectile – go make some music!

-   Tinted Glass has been added to the game!

-   Tinted Glass is a type of glass that does not allow light to pass through

### Smeltable Ore Drops

-   Added Raw Copper, Raw Iron and Raw Gold items
-   Ores that are smeltable now drop raw item forms of the ore instead of the ore block, and these can be smelted just like before
-   This is to open up the design space for more base stones with ores without cluttering the inventory, and have consistency with Fortune on all ores
-   Ore blocks will continue to be smeltable, meaning you can smelt ore blocks from inventories on old worlds

### Raw Ore Blocks

-   Added Block of Raw Iron, Copper, and Gold
-   Just like other ore materials, you can craft a compact version with raw ore items in order to save inventory space

-   Growth speed is random but very slow, a single growth step can take several Minecraft days
-   A Stalactite will only trigger growth if it is max 7 in length, and if the Stalagmite or floor is max 10 blocks below
-   If the stalactite tip is inside water it won't drip, and therefore won't trigger any growth
-   If the Stalagmite tip is underwater it won't receive drops, and therefore won't be grown by a dripping Stalactite. Same thing if there is any fluid between the two tips
-   A Stalagmite or Stalactite will never grow into a fluid
