## **Items**

-   Fixed an issue with Signs not displaying the saved text upon placement
-   The "has\_equipment" filter once again supports data values

## **Mobs**

-   Added a new field "transform\_to\_item" to the "minecraft:ageable" component. If the field is filled with an item name, the item will be given back when any of "feed\_items" are used. Similar to "transform\_to\_item" in the "minecraft:breedable" component
