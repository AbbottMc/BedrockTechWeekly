## **Animation**

-   Fixed a bug that caused animations to be restarted when changing render controllers

## **Graphical**

-   Fixed text on Signs losing their formatting when new lines or word-wrapping are encountered. Formatting will now persist until the reset code or an overriding code is found. This is not retroactive and previously created Signs will not be changed

## **Graphics**

-   As part of continued testing, removed RenderDragon engine on Android devices (ARMv7)

## **Molang**

-   Molang expressions that contain capital letters are properly evaluated now
-   'query.get\_equipped\_item\_name' will now recognize Sea Lantern ([MCPE-67893](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-67893))
-   Add new compile errors for expressions like 1 + (9 10), which were previously ignored (This is a Versioned Change as of engine version 1.17.40)

## **GameTest Framework (Experimental)**

-   Updated the GameTest Framework interface and added a new SimulatedPlayer capability:
    -   Added 'SimulatedPlayer'class to GameTest. This class enables GameTest to simulate a variety of player behaviors such as movement, using items, and interacting with blocks and entities. See the [GameTest API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/scriptapi/mojang-gametest/mojang-gametest) reference documentation for more details.
        -   Added function spawnSimulatedPlayer(blockLocation: BlockLocation, name: string): SimulatedPlayer
        -   Added function   
            removeSimulatedPlayer(simulatedPlayer: SimulatedPlayer): void
    -   mojang-gametest.Test type
        -   Changed signature of function assertEntityInstancePresent(entity: Entity, blockLocation: BlockLocation, isPresent: boolean = true)
    -   mojang-minecraft components
