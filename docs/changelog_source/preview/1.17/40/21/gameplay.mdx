Hello? Hello? Can anyone hear me? I’m in a newly generated cave and, I’m not saying I’m lost, but I most certainly don’t know how to find my way out. I know I followed a copper ore vein that was deeper than usual and all of a sudden, I’m below one of my saved chunks and here we are. While I try to dig myself out, please enjoy this week’s Bedrock Beta update and send us your feedback at [aka.ms/CavesCliffsFeedback](http://aka.ms/CavesCliffsFeedback) and report any bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](http://bugs.mojang.com/).  And if the rest of the Bedrock team asks where I am, just tell them I’m stuck in traffic. They will never let me live this down…
