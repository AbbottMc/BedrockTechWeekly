We weathered many a storm, blasted through blizzards, survived the blistering sun, and then hailed a cab so we could deliver a new Bedrock update beta! All you have to do is enable the Caves & Cliffs Experimental Features Toggle and then dive into new features like the 3D biomes with multi noise generation!

These features are still in the early stages, but we would love to hear your feedback at [aka.ms/CavesCliffsFeedback](https://aka.ms/CavesCliffsFeedback), and you can search and report any new bugs you may encounter at bugs.mojang.com. You can read more about the experimental toggle at [aka.ms/MCExperimentalToggle](https://aka.ms/MCExperimentalToggle).

## **Before You play! The world generation in this beta is expected to be slow, especially if you are playing on an older device. We are working on improving the generation speed before the Caves & Cliffs Part II release, but those fixes are not ready to implement yet. You can let us know how the game runs in this short survey:** [**aka.ms/MCBetaPerf**](https://aka.ms/MCBetaPerf)

# **Caves & Cliffs Experimental Features**

## **Multi Noise World Generation**

-   New and improved terrain and biome generation algorithm that creates more natural terrain and biome transitions
-   Improved surface decoration that detects the difference between when blocks are generated underwater and underground
-   Introduces large ore veins to world generation adding more strategy to mining
-   Introduces noodle caves to world generation, creating small pathways between bigger caves
-   Introduces the possibility of dry cave entrances that make it easier to access the new noise caves
-   Introduces a new algorithm that finds suitable spawn positions closer to origin
-   Added logic to save and load SubChunks by absolute Y index to support data-driven dimension height ranges
