## Camera

-   Added the view offset to the 3rd person camera for the experimental _follow\_orbit_ preset
    -   The view offset is anchored to a pivot point at the center of the screen. When applied to the follow\_orbit preset, the player is shifted to be at a distance from center specified by the the offset.
    -   The range for this offset is -100 to 100
    -   This can be set by both commands and JSON
        -   /camera @s set minecraft:follow\_orbit view\_offset viewX viewY
    -   A new learning portal article detailing the 3rd person camera, including JSON syntax, will be published soon.
-   Added starting radius and rotation to the _follow\_orbit_ and 3rd person boom camera presets
    -   The starting radius (distance from player) is fixed right now at 10 blocks from the player position.
    -   The starting rotation (pitch and yaw) are fixed right now at 45X and 45Y.
    -   The follow orbit camera is the only preset available, the 3rd person boom preset will be coming in a future release.
-   Exposed radius component to behavior packs to be overwritten by creator cameras. Also added ‘minecraft:third\_person’ and ‘minecraft:third\_person\_front’ to the allow list of presets that can be inherited from
    -   This allows you to make a 3rd person camera based on the vanilla 3rd person cameras but with a variable radius.  
        The radius (distance from player) is not limited but render distance and other constraints still exist.
    -   This does **_not_** allow modifications to the vanilla cameras.

## Editor

-   Removed Keybinding for ‘D’ from Paste Preview which blocked movement right. Fixed Distance mode can be selected using the side-panel
-   Fixed missing CTRL+X key binding in Editor
-   Expanded the Block Palette Service API to allow management of Block Palettes and Block Palette Items
-   Added radial drag to number input fields, allowing value changes with mouse drag movement
-   Introduced a new script brush manager method _getBrushVolume_ which, given a set of brush pipeline operations, builds an absolute compound block volume for the brush
-   Fixed bug where small movements in the brush tool caused incorrect cursor tracking

## Entity Components

-   Added a _wind\_burst\_on\_hit_ subcomponent for Projectiles which creates a wind burst upon collision with an entity or block before being removed from the world
-   Wind Charges no longer burst when removed by command

## General

-   “minecraft:scatter\_feature” now has a “distribution” field like “minecraft:feature\_rules” to define the scattering settings. Features now use schema version “1.21.10”
-   [Learning portal documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/reference/content/featuresreference/examples/features/minecraftscatter_feature?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable) on this feature will be updated with the full release

## Items

-   Released _minecraft:custom\_components_ item component out of experimental in json formats 1.21.10 and higher
-   Introduced “slot.armor.body” as an extra armor slot for entities, like horses, limited to a single armor item but needing the effects of a full armor set
-   Introduced the “minecraft:damage\_absorption” item component, enabling items to absorb damage intended for their wearer
    -   The “absorbable\_causes” field allows to specify which damage causes to absorb
    -   Absorbed damage depletes the item’s durability, and surplus damage is ignored
    -   Requires equipping the item in an armor slot for damage to be absorbed
    -   When multiple damage absorbing items are equipped, a suitable one is selected at random to absorb incoming damage
-   Introduced the “minecraft:durability\_sensor” item component, enabling items to emit sounds and particles when damage causes them to lose durability
    -   The “durability\_thresholds” field allows to define a list of both durability thresholds and the effects to emit when they are met
    -   When the item receives enough damage to meet multiple thresholds at the same time, only the one corresponding to the lowest durability is considered
-   Learning portal documents on these features and how to use them are being written and will be available soon

## Realms

-   Fixed a bug that prevented two back-to-back error screens when the client was out of date and a Realm had a pending update
