Here’s what’s new in the latest Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Beta and Preview update! Please keep sending in any suggestions you have at [feedback.minecraft.net](https://feedback.minecraft.net), and please report and upvote any bugs you find at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/)!

# Features and Bug Fixes

## Trial Spawner

-   Fixed some Trial Spawner texture inconsistencies ([MCPE-181455](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-181455))

## Commands

-   Music will no longer be stopped by the '/stopsound' command

## Game Tips

-   Added a swim tip for touch devices
-   How to move is now taught to players on touch devices with the D-pad control scheme 

Sometimes it’s not a good time to learn new game play skills. For example, opening your inventory is not a relevant skill when you just discovered that the floor is lava. So here are some additional constraints for when game tips don’t show up:

-    The swim game tip only shows up when you are in water
-   The break block tip is the most relevant tip when you're freezing in powder snow. Other tips won't show up
-   When there are hostile mobs nearby you can still learn skills that will help you run away (movement, jumping and camera movement) but other tips won’t bother you

## Gameplay

-   Slabs and Stairs should no longer randomly start placing on the bottom when continuously building ([MCPE-54855](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-54855))

    -   Will behave like other Stone Slabs, eg. cannot be destroyed by fire, but will look like an ordinary oak slab
    -   "minecraft:petrified\_oak\_slab" can only be obtained and placed through commands
-   The Oak-Slab-looking variation of "double\_stone\_block\_slab" (aux value 2) is now flattened into its own new block "minecraft:petrified\_oak\_double\_slab" ([MCPE-180964](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-180964))
