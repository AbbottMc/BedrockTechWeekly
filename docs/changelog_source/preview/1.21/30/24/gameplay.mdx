It's time for a new Minecraft Preview and Beta! We’d love your feedback on bundles, so please let us know what you think at [aka.ms/mcbundlesfeedback](https://aka.ms/mcbundlesfeedback), and report any bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](http://bugs.mojang.com/).

# Experimental Features

## Bundles

-   Bundle recipe is now unlocked by obtaining Leather or String
-   Bundle now has the correct animation when adding and removing items on touch screen devices 
-   Moving a stack of multiple items into a Bundle now correctly moves any existing identical items to the top
-   Undyed Shulker Boxes can no longer be placed inside Bundles ([MCPE-185477](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-185477))
-   "Up" direction with gamepad's right-stick now correctly navigates in the Bundle's submenu
-   The Bundle tooltip now fits 3 rows and can always show at least 8 item types

\> **Developer's Note:** _Items fill up a Bundle in rows of four, and when a row is full it is pushed down by the row above. This means there can be empty spaces in the top row.  
\>   
\> In the previous 2020 Bundle experiment, items filled in from the top without leaving any gaps. We changed this behaviour because it meant that items moved left and right in the Bundle as new items were added. This made it more difficult for some players to keep track of the order of items and some even reported that the items were moving randomly!  
\>   
\> With only two rows in the tooltip, the behavior of pushing a full row of items further down the Bundle removed half of the visible items, which was too much. We're adding a third row to make the design work better and allow players to see more of the items in their Bundles as they fill up._

-   **Known Issue:** Bundles that are placed inside another Bundle may lose their contents when moved in and out of a Chest

# Features and Bug Fixes

## Gameplay

-   Mobs equipped with Maces can now perform Smash attacks

## Realms

-   The Realms backup list now displays the date that the backup was created, instead of the age of the backup

## Sounds

-   Sculk charge particles now have sound
-   Wither Skeleton now has its own "step" sound ([MCPE-174857](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-174857))

## Stability and Performance

-   Fixed a crash that could occur when loading texture data ([MCPE-184728](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-184728))

## Trial Chambers

-   Due to some unforeseen issues, we are reverting the Trial Chambers fixes which were introduced in the ([1.21.30.21](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/28896769176845)) Bedrock Preview release
-   However, the addition of the Hopper and Barrel setup will remain
-   We aim to reintroduce these fixes in a future release, once the core issues has been resolved

\> **Developer's Note:** _We are reverting these fixes to address some underlying issues that were creating a lot of errors in already generated Trial Chambers. While not an easy decision to make, we're doing this to avoid introducing any of these errors in your existing worlds that would risk breaking them._

## User Interface

-   Hardcore worlds will now show a gray border in the new Play and Edit World screens if the player has died in it  (Preview only)
-   The icons for the effects will now change size depending on the GUI scale ([MCPE-180238](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-180238)) 
-   Fixed an issue where the world seed template button may be missing in the Create New World screen

## Template Screen

We've introduced a new Template screen. Here’s what you can expect showing up over next couple of Previews:

-   Create a world from a template
-   All content related to templates divided into 3 tabs:
    -   **Marketplace Pass tab:** a selection of templates that are included in the Marketplace Pass subscription
    -   **Featured creators tab:** a curated selection of templates designed by Minecraft creators (with the option to discover even more in Marketplace).
    -   **Owned by me tab**: All the templates you have purchased. From here you can create a world from a template and rate the template.
-   **Search bar, filter and sort**: Quickly search through your templates with the search bar and refine the results with the filter and sort order.
-   **Subscribe to the Marketplace Pass**: Discover all the contents of the pass and register easily.
