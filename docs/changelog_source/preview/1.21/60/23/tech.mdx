## Add-Ons and Script Engine

-   Added the ability to define the order for the items for the creative inventory & recipe book, called the crafting item catalog, for new items added by packs. New items can either merge with existing groups, create new groups with your own item for the icon, or just become added as loose items without a group. This catalog should be saved as `item_catalog/crafting_item_catalog.json` in your behavior pack  
    Example:

    \{
       "format_version": "1.21.60",
       "minecraft:crafting_items_catalog": \{
          "categories": [
             \{
                // Valid values are construction, equipment, nature, and items
                "category_name": "construction",
                "groups": [
                   \{
                      // This will add the items to the end of the
                      // existing planks group
                      "group_identifier": \{
                         "icon": "minecraft:oak_planks",
                         "name": "minecraft:itemGroup.name.planks"
                      \},
                      "items": [
                         "mynamespace:my_planks1",
                         "mynamespace:my_planks2"
                      ]
                   \},
                   \{
                      // This will create a new group
                      "group_identifier": \{
                         "icon": "mynamespace:my_item",
                         // This is the name of your group which doubles as
                         // the localization string. The namespace is required
                         "name": "mynamespace:my_group_name"
                      \},
                      "items": [
                         "mynamespace:my_item"
                      ]
                   \},
                   \{
                      // This adds items without being part of a
                      // group as loose items
                      "items": [
                         "mynamespace:my_loose_item"
                      ]
                   \}
                ]
             \}
          ]
       \}
    \}
    

-   Item and Block json files now require a namespace for group names in the "menu\_category" object. 
-   Added new Creator toggle setting \`Show Content Log GUI On Error During Load.
    -   This setting with make the Content Log GUI automatically open and display after loading into a world and there was either warnings or errors found during the loading process.
    -   This setting is disabled in the Editor.

## Commands

-   Fixed a bug that would cause messages to report double the items that match the criteria when using the clear command with a max count of 0 
-   the "mine" overload of the /loot command has been moved to outside of Upcoming Creator Features experiments:
-   The /kick command now allows use of target selectors on Realms

## Components

-   Added the "minecraft:renders\_when\_invisible" component, which enables entities to render even when invisible
    -   Appropriate rendering behavior can then be specified in the corresponding "minecraft:client\_entity"

## Editor

-   Daylight cycle and multiplayer options are now respected in an exported world
-   Bedrock Dedicated Server would not correctly load an existing Editor project unless the `Editor=true` command line argument was used - resulting in connected Editor clients missing windows.

    -   Q, E, Shift + Q and Shift + E have been added as viewport keyboard shortcuts for increasing and decreasing fly speed
-   `/reload` (and the `Reload Scripts` action bar item) should now work in the editor when hosting a session, or connected to a remote session (when only a single player is connected).

## Network Protocol

-   Added ActorFlags::RENDERS\_WHEN\_INVISIBLE
