## Aim Assist

-   Aim assist will now only allow interactions within player's interact distance

<Switcher techSapi={<TechSapiExp/>} techSapiDiff={undefined}/>

## Camera

-   Block and entity targeting of Aim assist will now apply to touch control modes: 'Joystick & tap to interact' and 'D-Pad & tap to interact' 

## Experimental

-   Removed the Creator Cameras: Focus Target Camera experimental toggle 

## Gameplay

-   Focus Target Camera now displays a command output error when trying to target an entity when not on a free camera or custom camera that inherits from free camera. 
-   Focus Target Camera `vertical_rotation_limits` are now in world space. 0 degrees is straight down, 90 degrees is horizontal and 180 degrees is straight up. The limits for the values are \[0, 180\] inclusive.

## User Interface

Added full support and fixes for some input glyph replacement strings. This is to make them work across all the platforms (PC, Consoles, Mobile).  
These are the values fixed:

-   :\_input\_key.forward:
-   :\_input\_key.back:
-   :\_input\_key.left:
-   :\_input\_key.right:
-   :\_input\_key.inventory:
-   :\_input\_key.use:
-   :\_input\_key.chat:
-   :\_input\_key.attack:
-   :\_input\_key.sprint:  
    The icons for these strings are updated in diverse areas of the game that support contextual glyphs, such as: signs, signed books, tags, chat, commands.  
    Also, as improvement, replacement of these values depends on the interaction/control mode when using touch as input mode. These modes are Joystick & tap to interact, D-Pad & tap to interact, and Joystick & aim crosshair.
