<Switcher techSapi={<TechSapiStable/>} techSapiDiff={undefined}/>

-   Removed "Upcoming Creator Feature" toggle requirement for `minecraft:item_visual` component.
-   Updated `"minecraft:material_instances"` component
    -   Removed **UpcomingCreatorFeatures** experiment requirement for `"abmient_occlusion"` field to be float type 
-   Re-added new field `"ambient_occlusion_exponent"` to **blocks.json** file schema in resource packs, replaces broken `"brightness_gamma"` field. ([MCPE-188216](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-188216) , [MCPE-188221](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-188221)) 

## Components

-   The Strider now makes use of the minecraft:movement\_sound\_distance\_offset component for its movement sound distance offset

## Editor

-   Added Roughen brush to terrain tool
-   Added color picker hue gradient selector works for monochromatic values 
-   Updated Editor Compass body to toggle between NSEW directions and Axis directions (Z, -Z, X, -X) on click

## Entity Components

-   The "minecraft:breedable" component now has a field that enables the offspring's "minecraft:color" attribute to be a blend of the parents' "minecraft:color"
    -   "combine\_parent\_colors", If a color mutation will not happen, the baby will get a combination of the parents' colors if the colors are compatible. Color combinations follow the rules of DyeItem combinations. If the colors are not compatible the baby will get one of the parents colors chosen randomly
        -   Valid values: "true", "false"

## Entity Filters

-   Added new entity filter "home\_distance", which checks the distance of an entity from its home 
    -   Requires the subject entity to have a "minecraft:home" component
    -   Returns false if the subject has no home or if the home is in a different dimension
-   Added new entity filter "is\_bound\_to\_creaking\_heart", which checks if the Creaking Heart that spawned the subject Creaking still exists 

## Graphical

-   Improved logic for handling very large textures within atlases. Textures that are guaranteed to overflow the maximum atlas size will now have mips dropped individually rather than forcing the entire atlas to drop mips.

## Items

-   Added a content warning to the "minecraft:durability\_sensor" item component's "particle\_type" when an invalid value is provided 

## Sounds

-   Added "base" parameter to block sounds specifying another block sound they should use sounds for if they do not define a sound themselves

## Add-Ons and Script Engine

-   Updated Aim Assist, now it can only be used in third person camera perspectives. Switching to a unsupported camera type will disable aim assist

## Commands

-   Added support for input glyph replacement for signs, signed books, and NPC dialogs. For example, using input string ":\_input\_key.jump:" will be replaced with "JUMP" when using keyboard, or an emoji in case of using a gamepad.
