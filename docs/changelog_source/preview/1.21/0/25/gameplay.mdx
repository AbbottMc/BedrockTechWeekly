It's time for a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Beta and Preview update! As always, we want to hear your thoughts about how the [_Tricky Trials_](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/1-21-update-officially-named-tricky-trials) update is shaping up, so leave us any suggestions you have at [feedback.minecraft.net](https://feedback.minecraft.net), and please report any bugs you find to [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/)!

# Features and Bug Fixes

## Stability and Performance

-   Fixed not being able to load into worlds with some texture packs ([MCPE-180918](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-180918)) 

## Trial Spawner

-   Mobs removed by Trial Spawner converting to Ominous state now drop the items that they previously picked up from the ground 
-   Trial Spawners that are configured to spawn baby Zombies now spawn them correctly 

## Petrified Oak Slab

-   The oak-slab-looking variation of "stone\_block\_slab" (aux value 2) is now flattened into its own new block "minecraft:petrified\_oak\_slab" which will behave like other stone slabs, eg. cannot be destroyed by fire, but will look like an ordinary oak slab. "minecraft:petrified\_oak\_slab" can only be obtained through commands ([MCPE-180964](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-180964))
    -   Please note; this fix will _not_ revert slabs which have already been converted in the recent Preview

## Items

-   Fixed an issue that could cause missing textures when placing Paintings in some Marketplace worlds. Painting motifs from a version above the current session's will not be selected when placing a Painting

## Updated ‘Servers Tab’ Experience

-   We're glad to include the Message of the Day (MOTD) below each of the available servers!
