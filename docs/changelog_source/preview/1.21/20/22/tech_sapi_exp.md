CameraFixedBoomOptions

-   New interface added to beta
-   Allows you to customize \`minecraft:follow\_orbit\` cameras only when the third person camera presets toggle is enabled.
-   Introduces \`viewOffset?: Vector2\`. This property allows you to change the offset of the camera relative to the player to create an over the shoulder effect.
