## Editor

-   Selection now has a freehand select that uses brushes to paint
    
-   Updated general brush functionality:
    
    -   Brush shapes are visualized as grey wireframes, and show only affected blocks in yellow
    -   Cusor Control / Mouse Mode is now using a common control which is shared across extensions
    -   Brush Selection, Masking and Brush Properties is now using a custom control which is shared across extensions
    -   Brush Painting now visualizes only affected blocks
-   Added `addToggleGroup` function to `IPropertyPane` API to create toggle groups with selectable icon buttons

-   Added a new settings screen in `View \> View Settings` to configure certain view related settings (like invisible block visibility and chunk boundaries)
    
-   Added mouse button event data to the widget state change event so that server scripts can track mouse button events (press, release, drag) and the state of modifier keys (shift, ctrl)
    
-   Added an optional `infoTooltip: TooltipInteractiveContent` property to `IRootPropertyPane` API, displayed as an icon in the drawer header. Interactive tooltips remain active on hover and support links and paragraphs.
    
-   Added `serialize(obj)` and `deserialize(string)` functions. These act like JSON.stringify/JSON.parse but will use custom serializers/deserializers registered with `registerSerializationForType`
    
    -   `CompoundBlockVolume` and `BlockVolume` are able to be serialized and deserialized with these functions

-   Fixed issues with selection being cleared on tool focus change
