# Features and Bug Fixes

## Effects

-   Fixed an issue where the Shulker's bullet was incorrectly giving 200 seconds of levitation instead of the expected 10 ([MCPE-190710](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-190710))

## Gameplay

-   Bundles no longer become empty after being held by an Armor Stand ([MCPE-190093](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-190093))

## Mobs

-   To better support the long-term health of the Minecraft engine, we've made the difficult decision to fix an old splash potion bug that was used by some players to make invincible "pet" mobs. In worlds at or above version 1.21.70.24, any remaining invincible mobs will now properly die and despawn. ([MCPE-190466](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-190466))

## User Interface

-   Removed the server IP address from the servers tab ([MCPE-190747](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-190747))
