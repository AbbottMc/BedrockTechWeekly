## Components

-   Added validation for asset references in components
    -   Content errors will log missing references for the following fields:
        -   item references
        -   block reference in item component in "minecraft:block\_placer"
        -   loot table reference in block component "minecraft:loot"
-   The "entity\_sensor" component's "find\_players\_only" field now functions correctly, properly restricting searches to Players only and affecting all subsensors

## Dedicated Server

-   Exposed two new parameters for dedicated server when in server-auth-with-rewind. These will make the server more strict on player positions. Look in server.properties for more information on what these do
    -   server-authoritative-movement-strict default to false and can be set to true. Will affect Player position acceptance
    -   server-authoritative-dismount-strict default to false and can be set to true. Will affect Player position when dismounting

## Editor

-   Added `IButtonPanePropertyItem` API for customizing button layouts
    -   `IPropertyPane.addButtonPane` and `IModalControlPane.addButtonPane` API methods to create button pane items
-   Updated the mouse indicator for various tools to no longer linger after the app is suspended and resumed
-   Updated the maximum allowed line segments in Line Tool to 40 to address a crash

## Entity Event Responses

-   Added the "stop\_movement" entity event response, which stops the entity's movement
    -   The "stop\_vertical\_movement" field specifies whether vertical movement should be stopped
    -   The "stop\_horizontal\_movement" field specifies whether horizontal movement should be stopped
    -   This response does not stop navigation or prevent future movement
        -   If that's the desired outcome, also remove the components responsible for that
-   Added the "set\_home\_position" entity event response, which sets the entity's home position to its current position
    -   For this to have any effect, the entity must already have a "minecraft:home" component

## Entity Events

-   Added "first\_valid" event type, it will evaluate every filter in order and execute the first valid one

## Entity Filters

-   The "in\_clouds" entity filter now succeeds when an entity's bounding box intersects the cloud layer, rather than only when its bottom is within it

## Jigsaw

-   Fixed gaps from appearing between data-driven jigsaw structure pieces.

## Mobs

-   Added aquatic family-type for all aquatic mobs
-   Normal Minecart is no longer considered a mob
