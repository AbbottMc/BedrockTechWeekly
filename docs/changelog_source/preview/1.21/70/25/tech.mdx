## Biomes

### Client Biome Components

-   Add `minecraft:dry_foliage_color` component to override color for `dry_foliage` tint method

## Blocks

-   Empty Bell blocks no longer crash the game when moved by a sticky piston ([MCPE-188687](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-188687))
-   Updated the /fill, /clear and /testforblock Commands
    -   Fixed a bug where these commands would recognize IDs of some flattened blocks as block group names and affect all variants under those groups
-   Add `dry_foliage` tint method which uses the `textures/colormap/dry_foliage.png` color map
-   Exposed the Block component minecraft:destruction\_particles as a JSON object. This represents the particles used when the Block is destroyed
    -   There is two fields for it:
        -   "texture" is a required string field to set the texture used by the particles
        -   "tint\_method" is an optional string field that multiplies the texture color with a predefined tint. Default to "none". Supported values are "none", "default\_foliage", "birch\_foliage", "evergreen\_foliage", "dry\_foliage", "grass" and "water".
    -   Block format before 1.21.70 will be upgraded to have the component added using the texture from the "down" or "\*" of the minecraft:material\_instances component if present and "none" for tint\_method. This was the old behavior.
    -   Block format from 1.21.70 without the component will not be upgraded and uses the invalid texture  
        Examples:
        
             "minecraft:destruction_particles": \{
              "texture": "my_particles_texture",
              "tint_method": "grass"
             \}
            
        
        or
        
            "minecraft:destruction_particles": \{
             "texture": "my_particles_texture"
            \}
            
        

## Bug

-   Fixed issue that occurs when cancelling world resource pack download
-   Fixed crash that occurs when initializing `minecraft:decorated_pot` renderer

## Commands

-   Removed set\_movement\_authority command.

## Dedicated Server

-   Exposed a new parameter for dedicated server. This will make the server more strict on entity interactions. Look in server.properties for more information on what these do
    -   server-authoritative-entity-interactions-strict default to false and can be set to true. Will affect Entity interaction acceptance
-   Removed server-authoritative-movement parameter. It will now always use server-auth-with-rewind.

## Editor

-   Added Realms integration
    -   Users can now publish their Editor project directly to Realms
    -   Users can download their Realms world
    -   **NOTE**: Users must be signed in and have an active Realms subscription. For Preview builds, they must have a Preview Realms first. This can be created in non-Editor mode of Bedrock on Preview builds.
-   Added better management of Structures:
    -   Added the ability to rename a structure
    -   Added the ability to delete a structure
    -   Added the ability to duplicate a structure
    -   Added the ability to rename the file/unique name
    -   Added the ability to change the namespace
    -   **NOTE**: Project structures will be exported to the `editor/structuredb` subdirectory in the world folder
-   Added the Grid Repeat feature to the Repeater tool, which includes both Uniform and Separate repeat types
-   Added visualization for the first layer added/removed in the extrude tool
-   Updated the default flyspeed to 4.0 while using Editor
-   Updated `IPropertyPane.addTable` API function to `IPropertyPane.addDataTable`
-   Updated `IBlockListPropertyItem` and rename `ITablePropertyItem` to `IDataTablePropertyItem` APIs
-   Fixed missing Air and Sugarcane block images
-   Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the refresh button to crash Editor
-   Fixed a bug that caused farms to be placed near unloaded areas
-   Fixed a bug that prevented slider to be visually updated for `INumberPropertyItem.updateLimits` API function

## Gameplay

-   CommandBlock hover name now shown in GUI messages generated from commands ([MCPE-190606](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-190606))

## General

-   Server Authoritative movement is now turned on by default
