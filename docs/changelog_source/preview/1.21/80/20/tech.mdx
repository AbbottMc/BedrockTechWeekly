        -   "on\_top\_center", riders are placed at the center of the top of the entity's collision box

### General

-   Updated the client side biome component 'minecraft:water\_appearance' field 'surface\_color' to be optional. Added a content error that fires if the component is empty.

### Goals

-   minecraft:behavior.float\_wander has been updated with new fields:
    
    -   navigate\_around\_surface: enables the usage of a new algorithm to find random positions to navigate to. The new algorithm aims to find random positions in the vicinity of solid (i.e. non-Air and non-liquid) blocks, and if that fails will fall back to finding a random position in the vicinity of the current dimension's surface level.
    -   additional\_collision\_buffer: makes sure there are no blocks present in an inflated area around the target position.
    -   allow\_navigating\_through\_liquids: allow the mob to have target positions inside liquids
    -   surface\_xz\_dist: the distance in the horizontal directions to look for nearby surfaces. Only valid when navigate\_around\_surface is true.
    -   surface\_y\_dist: the distance in the vertical directions to look for nearby surfaces. Only valid when navigate\_around\_surface is true.
-   minecraft:behavior.follow\_mob has been updated with the following new fields
    
    -   use\_home\_position\_restriction: If true, the mob will respect the 'minecraft:home' component's 'restriction\_radius' field when choosing a target to follow. If false, it will choose target position without considering home restrictions.
    -   preferred\_actor\_type: The type of actor to prefer following. If left unspecified, a random actor among those in range will be chosen.
    -   filters: If non-empty, provides criteria for filtering which nearby Mobs can be followed. If empty default criteria will be used, which will exclude Players, Squid variants, Fish variants, Tadpoles, Dolphins, and mobs of the same type as the owner of the Goal.

### Marketplace

-   Upon reading encrypted files on Xbox we would sometimes lose the last byte, causing some files to become invalid and fail to load.

### Network Protocol

-   Added ActorFlags::DOES\_SERVER\_AUTH\_ONLY\_DISMOUNT

### Structures

-   Fixed mirroring of door blocks when part of a structure that is being placed.
