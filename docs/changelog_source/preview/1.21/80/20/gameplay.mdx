Now that all of the features for the first game drop of 2025 are in testing, we thought we'd get started on our next game drop, starting with… the Player Locator bar! If your friends are always wandering off in multiplayer, this new bar will help you track them down! This bar replaces the XP bar in multiplayer mode and indicates other players' location using colorful icons. If you're a stealth player who likes to surprise your friends, then you can stay off your friends' radars by sneaking, disguising yourself, or by drinking a potion of Invisibility. Test the locator bar now in Bedrock Preview and Beta, and don't forget to send in your feedback at [feedback.minecraft.net](https://feedback.minecraft.net/)! You can also report any bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/). The Player Locator bar is coming to Java snapshot soon.

## Experimental Features

### Locator Bar

The Locator Bar is a new UI element on the Player HUD that displays the direction of other Players in the World.

When the Locator Bar Experiment is enabled and there are multiple Players in a World, the Locator Bar will appear on-screen for each Player, replacing the Experience Bar. The Player Level number will still be visible as before above the Locator Bar.

The Locator Bar will display colored indicators when the camera is facing within 120 degrees towards another Player. If another Player is 30 degrees above or below the camera's viewport (the screen) an up or down arrow will be displayed.

Crouching will hide the Player, preventing their indicator from appearing on the Locator Bar of other Players.

Players in Spectator Mode are not visible on the Locator Bar.

A Mob Head or a Carved Pumpkin will similarly hide Players from the Locator Bar when worn in the head slot.

Using a Potion of Invisibility will also hide players from the Locator Bar.

\> **Developer's note:** When the Locator Bar moves out of experimental, we plan on making it a feature that Players can toggle on and off.

#### Known Issues

-   The Locator Bar has the following known issue, so we recommend testing it with a Simulation Distance of 4 chunks
    -   If the Simulation Distance is set to greater than 4 chunks then the Locator Bar may not show players in between 4 chunks and the Simulation Distance
