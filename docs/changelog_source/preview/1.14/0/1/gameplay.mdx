### **New Features:**

-   **Added Bees!**

-   Bees are cute, fuzzy, neutral mobs
-   Don’t hurt them, they don’t want to hurt you
-   If a bee does sting you, it will leave its stinger in you and eventually die, dropping nothing :(
-   Bees love pretty flowers and spend their lives gathering pollen from them
-   After gathering pollen, bees fly back to their home nest
-   Bees help you by growing crops while carrying pollen back to the nest
-   Bees can be bred using flowers
-   If a bee can't find nectar, after a while it will return home for a bit
-   If a bee doesn’t have a home nest, it will wander around until it finds one it can use
-   Bees don’t like the rain and they sleep at night. They will go back to the nest in these cases

-   **Added Beehives and Nests**
    -   Bee Nests spawn naturally in Flower Forests, Plains, and Sunflower Plains biomes
    -   When a bee visits a nest and completes its journey undisturbed, the level of honey increases
    -   Max of 5 levels of honey
    -   Beehives are crafted by players using honeycomb and wood planks
    -   Use a silk touch tool to get the block with the bees stored inside
    -   Bee Nests will be destroyed unless you use silk touch
    -   Use shears when at full honey to get honeycomb
    -   Use a bottle when at full honey to get a honey bottle
    -   Campfire smoke calms bees - place one underneath the nest / hive to keep them in chill mode
    -   Redstone-friendly!

-   **Added Honeycomb and Honey Bottles**
    -   Use an empty glass bottle on a hive or nest that is full of honey to get a bottle of honey!

    -   Dispensers can now shear honeycombs from Bee Nests and Hives

-   **Added Honeycomb blocks**

-   **Added Honey blocks**
    -   Greatly reduces movement speed and jump height, but also reduce fall damage
    -   You can “slide” down a wall of honey blocks to slow your fall (parkour ftw!)
    -   Honey Block effects carry through up to \< 1 block above
    -   When a honey block is piston-moved, adjacent blocks are moved too
    -   When a honey block is piston-moved, entities on top are moved along with it
    -   Sticky Block Support. Use the ‘BlockProperty::PreventsJumping’ to make it so that the pathfinder won't jump if on one of these blocks and players can't jump when on one of these blocks. Also hooked up level event that spawns terrain particles when prevented from jumping and plays the jump.prevent block sound
