## **Experimental Features**

### **Cherry Grove**

- Introducing the Cherry Grove biome, with pretty Cherry Blossom trees. You can find it in the mountains, like Meadows
- It has a new flower, Pink Petals, as ground cover, which can be crafted into Pink Dye
- Pigs, Rabbits, Sheep, and Bees spawn there
- Comes with a new wood set for the Cherry Blossom trees

### **Decorated Pot**

- Tweaked the Decorated Pot neck based on feedback ([MCPE-167168](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-167168))
  - With the former pot, we decided that the pot's neck would clip with blocks so it would be extra flexible to build with. However, we've had some Z-fighting issues which means that 2 objects are in the same exact position and this causes flickering. With this new block model we prevent that and the pot looks a little bit more complex!
- Decorated Pot no longer provides support for blocks wanting to attach to its side faces ([MCPE-167165](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-167165))
- Decorated Pot is not stackable in Inventory ([MCPE-167223](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-167223))

- Updated archer Pottery Shard texture
