The days of your anonymous armor are over, because armor trims are coming to Bedrock as experimental features this week! Templates for the different trims can be found all over the Minecraft world, so stock up on supplies and start searching! Once you get your hands on a template, use the smithing table to dye and apply it to a helmet, leggings, chest plate, or boots. Now you are not only stylish and colourful, but also humble since you no longer need to use words to brag about your adventurous travels! Check out armor trims along with suspicious gravel and other new features that will join Minecraft in the Trails & Tales Update later this year. Don’t forget to send us all your feedback and ideas at [aka.ms/MC120Feedback](http://aka.ms/MC120Feedback) and report any bugs to [bugs.mojang.com](http://bugs.mojang.com/)

# **Experimental Features**

## **Armor Trims**

-   You can now visually customize your armor with a variety of unique trims at the Smithing Table
-   Armor Trims are purely visual with no gameplay benefits, and can only be applied to Helmets, Chestplates, Leggings, and Boots
    -   All trim patterns are visually the same on an armor's item icon, but the color will still change based on the trim material
    -   To check which trim pattern a piece of armor has, you can hover over it in the inventory
-   Armor Trim Smithing Templates can be found all throughout the world, and each of the following structures contain their own unique Smithing Template:
    -   Pillager Outpost
        -   Sentry Armor Trim
    -   Desert Pyramid
        -   Dune Armor Trim
    -   Shipwreck
        -   Coast Armor Trim
    -   Jungle Temple
        -   Wild Armor Trim
    -   Ocean Monument
        -   Tide Armor Trim
    -   Ancient City
        -   Ward Armor Trim
    -   Woodland Mansion
        -   Vex Armor Trim
    -   Nether Fortress
        -   Rib Armor Trim
    -   Bastion Remnant
        -   Snout Armor Trim
    -   Stronghold
        -   Eye Armor Trim
    -   End City
        -   Spire Armor Trim
    -   Smithing Templates are found in Chests in their respective structure, except for the Ocean Monument. Instead of finding it in Chests, Elder Guardians sometimes drop a Smithing Template when defeated
    -   Some Armor Trim Smithing Templates are rarer than others, so be on the lookout for them to impress your friends!
    -   An Armor Trim has two properties: a pattern and a material
        -   The pattern is defined by the Smithing Template used to apply the trim, and represents the visual pattern of the trim
        -   The material is defined by what ingredient you used to apply the trim, and represents the color of the trim
    -   The viable ingredients you can use to define the color of your Armor Trim are the following:
        -   Iron
        -   Copper
        -   Gold
        -   Lapis
        -   Emerald
        -   Diamond
        -   Netherite
        -   Redstone
        -   Amethyst
        -   Quartz

## **Blocks**

-   The Piglin Head Block's ears now flap when the wearer is Riding a vehicle
-   Cherry Stripped Wood can now be crafted from Cherry Stripped Log ([MCPE-168053](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-168053))

## **Netherite Equipment**

-   Netherite equipment crafting now also requires a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template
-   Netherite Upgrade Smithing Templates can be found randomly in all Bastion Remnant chests, and there is a guarantee of 2 in every Treasure Room Bastion Remnant
-   This change was made for a variety of reasons:
    -   Increases the time players utilize Diamond equipment before Netherite
    -   Make Netherite equipment a more significant achievement in the game's progression
    -   Adapts Netherite more naturally into the new Smithing Table crafting system

## **Smithing Templates**

-   Smithing Tables have been redesigned into a workstation for physical equipment upgrades and modifications
-   Alongside slots for combining a piece of equipment and materials, there is now a required slot for an item type called Smithing Templates
-   Smithing Templates define what type of upgrade you will be making to equipment
    -   It specifies both what type of items you can upgrade, and which ingredients are valid to customize the upgrade
    -   There are currently two categories of Smithing Templates: Armor Trim and Netherite Upgrade
-   Smithing Templates are consumed when used to upgrade an item in the Smithing Table
-   You can craft a copy of a Smithing Template in the Crafting Table with 7 Diamonds + 1 block of material that the template is made out of + 1 Smithing Template, which will output 2 of the same Smithing Template
