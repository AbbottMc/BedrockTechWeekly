Minecraft Live 2022 only wrapped a few days ago but we are all ready to try out the features that Agnes, Chi, and Nir told us about during the show! That’s right, the camel, bamboo wood set, chiseled bookshelf, and hanging signs are all in this week’s Minecraft Preview, so you can try them all out while they’re still fresh! Maybe that means watching a camel wiggle its ears for hours on end, floating around on a bamboo raft while watching the clouds, or curling up with a good book that you pulled from your chiseled bookshelf. Or you’re going to pick a fight with a herd of melée mobs from atop the tall camel, hang cryptic messages for your friends to find, and craft a secret passageway that masquerades as an innocent collection of books. Me? I’m going to lounge around on the Minecraft Live set before it gets taken down. Remember to send us all your feedback at [aka.ms/MC120Feedback](https://aka.ms/MC120Feedback) and report any bugs to [bugs.mojang.com](http://bugs.mojang.com/).
