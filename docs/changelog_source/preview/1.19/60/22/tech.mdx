## **Components**

-   Added "inventory" as a possible "domain" value for the "has\_equipment" filter, which allows to check for items stored in the actor's inventory
-   Added an "equip\_item\_slot" field to the "interact" component
    -   If set, an item held by the player will be equipped to the specified slot upon successful interaction
    -   If an item is already present in the specified slot, it will be moved to the player's inventory
    -   Equipping an item removes it from the player's inventory, unless the player is in Creative Mode
