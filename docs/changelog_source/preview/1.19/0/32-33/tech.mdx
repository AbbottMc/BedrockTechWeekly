## **Blocks**

-   Fixed behavior of Command Blocks when cloning another Command Block onto self where the cloned Command Block would not execute its command until a Redstone signal is toggled  
      
    

## **GameTest Framework (Experimental)**

-   Dedicated server has been updated to allow servers to explicitly list which script modules they want loaded when running scripts. A default configuration file is located atÂ /config/default/permissions.json. Without this new file, all script modules are disabled by default
