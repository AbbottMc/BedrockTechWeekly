# **Features and Bug Fixes**

## **Updated Touch Controls**

We have some exciting changes for mobile touch controls! These updates are only available in the Minecraft Preview currently, but we would love your feedback! Please let us know what you think in the feedback thread here: [https://aka.ms/mctouchfeedback](https://aka.ms/mctouchfeedback)

-   Implemented a button under Settings \> Touch to show the Touch Control Selection Screen which can be used to modify the selected control scheme
-   When the auto-jumping feature is enabled, the player will now automatically jump out of water when moving toward a block on land
-   In Creative Mode while using touch input with Action Buttons off, the delay for breaking the first block has been increased to 800 milliseconds. This reduces the chance of breaking a block by accident
-   Added support for dragging and dropping with touch gestures in the inventory
-   Added a more tailored user experience for stack splitting with touch, initiated by long pressing on a stack of items
-   Double tapping 'descend' now toggles off flight in Joystick touch control modes
