## **Experimental Gameplay:**

Some Update Aquatic features are more unstable and are currently behind the Experimental Gameplay toggle.

'Use Experimental Gameplay' can be toggled in World Settings. These features may break your world so a copy of your world will be created with "\[EX\]" before the world name. This feature cannot be disabled once it is enabled for a world and any progress will not be saved to the original world.
