## **Release Date:** April 3, 2018  
  
  
## **New Features:**

-   Realms now create automatic backups that can be downloaded and restored
-   Added two options to swap A/B buttons and X/Y buttons on controllers, which can be found in Controller Settings
-   Added menu screen transitions, which can be toggled in Settings

  
## **Changes:**

-   Many screens and actions now respond when a button is pressed instead of released so they now feel extra responsive
-   Palleted chunks! This means we can now have (almost) infinite different types of blocks (and also no more BlockIDs). It also means the game should be less likely to crash due to being out of memory
-   Falling on Hay Bales now reduces fall damage
-   Owned skin packs will now appear at the top of the Skin Picker
-   Purchased content will now auto-update, which can be toggled in Profile settings
-   Realms member lists can now be cleared from the Members screen
-   Updated look for the Marketplace and Search functionality to easily find specific content

  
## **Experimental Gameplay:**  
A handful of features from Update Aquatic have been added through Experimental Gameplay. These features are incomplete and are not representative of final gameplay but feedback is absolutely welcome! These are not all of the Update Aquatic features coming to Minecraft and more is on the way.  
  
'Use Experimental Gameplay' can be toggled in World Settings. This may break your world so a copy of your world will be created with ""\[EX\]"" before the world name. This feature cannot be disabled once it is enabled for a world and any progress will not be saved to the original world.
