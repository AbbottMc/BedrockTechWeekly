## **Missing Inventories after Updating to 1.5.0:**

Some players may have lost their item inventories and character progress after updating to 1.5.0. To recover inventory from a player that was lost, you will need to:

1.  Have had a Microsoft account or Nintendo account tied to that player when you last saw the player with its previous inventory. Without this, your data cannot be recovered
2.  Do not uninstall/reinstall the game on the machine you last saw your old inventory on – this will destroy the cached data needed to recover your lost inventory. Merely updating the game should be fine
3.  Log in to the same server, which has been upgraded to 1.5.3, from the same machine you last saw your old player/inventory on
4.  Be in an area which allows for chests to safely spawn. If you aren’t, the game should inform you, and try again the next time you log in

Without the Microsoft account or Nintendo account and the same device with the original data, the data cannot be recovered.
