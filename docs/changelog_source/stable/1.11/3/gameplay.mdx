**NOTE:** This hotfix is not available on Nintendo Switch as we are still working on addressing several crash issues for a future update. Multiplayer is still compatible with versions 1.11.0 through 1.11.3

## **Fixes:**

-   Fixed a crash that could occur when mobs found the nearest attackable mob
-   When converting from V1 to V2, villagers now keep their XP level
-   Villagers cured of zombification can no longer change their profession if they have enough XP ([MCPE-42348](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-42348))
-   Another fix for villagers changing their professions when they're not supposed to
-   Fixed pathfinding so when an entity can't float, swim, or be amphibious, it can still walk at the bottom of water
-   Fixed gamertags and gamerpics of Realms members not appearing on the members list
-   The Realms members list no longer returns to the first page when navigating to another page
-   When using commands, the villager and zombie\_villager target selectors now target both V1 and V2 mob types
