## **Changes:**

## **Updated _Create New World_ Experience**

Create New World is being updated with improved navigation, more descriptions, and a new look and feel. It’ll be rolled out gradually across Android, iOS, Windows, and Xbox starting today.

![Create_New_World.png](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/5522357974541/Create_New_World.png)

We’re still working on some things, like support for other platforms, screen narration, the trial version of the game, and the Japanese language. We need some more time to work on these features in order to provide the best possible experience.

We would love to hear what you think! Share your feedback on [the Feedback Site](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/topics/360000280611-User-Interface-Input-Methods-and-Menu-Options) and put “Create New World” in the title so we can find it.  
  

## **Realms World Storage**

## **RenderDragon**

-   The new Minecraft Bedrock rendering engine, RenderDragon, is now live on Android, iOS, Switch, and Windows 10 UWP x86 builds! Consolidating onto our new graphics engine will allow us to continue investing in future performance and stability improvements, as well as exciting new features for Minecraft!

## **Experimental Features:**

## **Reminder:** Remember to **make regular backup copies** of your favorite worlds before enabling experimental features!

Please keep in mind that these features are work in progress, still under in development, and subject to change. If you activate them, your world might crash, break, or not work with future updates. Experimental features cannot be turned off after world creation.

For more information, please see the article about enabling experimental features at [aka.ms/MCExperimentalFeatures](https://aka.ms/MCExperimentalFeatures).

## **Deep Dark Biome**

-   Dimly lit and eerie, the Deep Dark is sure to strike fear into the hearts of even the bravest players

## **Ancient Cities**

-   Wander the halls of these long-abandoned structures in the Deep Dark depths to uncover relics long forgotten

## **Warden**

## **Sculk Blocks**

-   A new variety of blocks that can be found in the Deep Dark

## **Darkness Effect**

## **Axe Changes**

## **Spectator Mode**

-   This update contains early functionality for Spectator Mode – a much-wanted feature we're adding to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. This will launch after the upcoming 1.19 update has shipped, but we’ll be testing it further in upcoming Betas and Previews. We recommend not relying on this in-development feature, which was not meant to be included in the release. We won't be accepting bug reports related to Spectator Mode until our first iteration is released, as the feature is likely to change during development.  
      
    

## **Known Issues:**

-   Teleporting entities into unloaded chunks removes them from the world. This will be fixed in an upcoming update
