This update was released only on iOS devices. It is still multiplayer compatible with other devices running version 1.2.13.  
  
## **iOS Purchases:**

-   Fixed the bug that caused players to not be able to see their purchased Minecoins and locked other content purchased previously

If you still have missing content, please be aware that some accounts require further processing on the server side and it may just take more time for your purchases to be shown. ""Purchasing"" the FREE ""Legacy Skin Pack"" in the Store may help make the process of restoring purchases faster. We apologize for any inconvenience this bug caused and we thank you for your patience.

-   Skin selections will once again save after closing the game or signing out
