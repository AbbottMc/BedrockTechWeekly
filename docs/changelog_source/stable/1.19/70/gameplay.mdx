-   Quick emoting with new hotkeys
-   Easier sorting of emotes

Check out the [New Emote Features for Bedrock Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/new-emote-features-bedrock-edition) article for more details.  
  

## **Vanilla Parity:**

Improvements have been made with vanilla parity to align with Java Edition, especially with horse breeding, mobs, and blocks.

## **Gameplay**

## **Mobs**

-   When breeding horses, the baby Horse now has a chance of being better than its parents in speed, jump strength, and health. This change is intended to make Horse breeding a viable way of getting great Horses, if a player starts with good parents and puts in enough time and Golden Carrots
-   Horses cannot be pushed over Fences covered by Carpets anymore ([MCPE-164717](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-164717))

## **Experimental Features:**

The Sniffer and Archaeology are now available for testing that are coming to Minecraft 1.20, [now known as **Trails & Tales**](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/the-trails---tales-update)! The sniffer and archeology are two experimental features that you can try out in this release.

As these features are still incomplete, in development, and considered a work in progress, be sure to backup your worlds before enabling experimental features. The features can be enabled by turning on the “Next Major Update” toggle in world settings.

## **Archaeology**

-   Added the Brush item
-   Added the Decorated Pot block
-   Added four Pottery Shards (Arms Up, Skull, Prize, and Archer)
-   Added the Suspicious Sand block
-   Added Suspicious Sand to the Desert Temple
-   Added Suspicious Sand to the Desert Well

## **Brush**

-   The Brush is a craftable item you can use to brush things

## **Pottery Shards and Decorated Pots**

-   Pottery Shards have pictures on them. They cannot be crafted and must be found in the world. Hint: you will need a Brush! By crafting four of these together you can create a Decorated Pot with a picture on each side.
-   You can also use Brick items instead of Pottery Shards in the crafting recipe. The sides that were made from Brick items will not have pictures.
-   Smash a Decorated Pot with any block-breaking tool to break it apart and get the Pottery Shards back! Or hit it with your fist to pick up the pot without breaking it.

## **Suspicious Sand**

-   Desert Temples and Desert Wells now contain Suspicious Sand. This fragile block is hard to spot and easy to destroy, so be careful!
-   If you manage to find the Suspicious Sand and brush it with your Brush, you will extract objects that were buried long ago.
-   We're giving you an early look at these Archaeology features. We want to spend more time developing them. Please let us know where you think we can improve or expand!

## **Sniffer**

-   The Sniffer is the mob vote winner of Minecraft Live 2022 and the first \[HS1\] extinct mob brought to life and added to the game
-   Sniffers cannot be tempted or tamed
-   Sniffers are passive friendly mobs
-   Sniffer sniffs in the air and occasionally dig for seeds

## **Torchflower**

-   The Torchflower seed can be planted on farmland and grows into a flower
-   The seed can be used to breed two Sniffers
-   The full-grown flower can be harvested and replanted but can also be crafted into a dye
