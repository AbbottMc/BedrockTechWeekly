## **New Features:**

## **Deep Dark**

-   In the depths of the Overworld, you will find one of the scariest biomes in all of Minecraft. Buried undergound, especially at the bottom of mountainous regions, this area is filled with sculk blocks, ancient structures, loot chests, and one, single, solitary mob. To navigate the deep dark, you need to sneak, use Silk Touch, and above all else – don’t wake the warden!

## **Warden**

-   The only mob that spawns in the deep dark is none other than the warden. The warden will only make an appearance if its slumber is disturbed, which means that brave explorers must sneak around very quietly. Quick movements risk setting off a sculk sensor that trigger a sculk shrieker. If you have the misfortune of hearing it pierce through the silent shroud of the deep dark, it’s time to get out. Even though the warden can’t see, this doesn’t slow it down but works to its advantage. The warden can sniff out any intruders and uses vibrations to detect their exact location.

## **Sculk Blocks**

-   There are five different types of sculk blocks to be found in the deep dark. If you want to mine them, you will need to stay stealthy and use Silk Touch. The sculk block is a great decorative block thanks to its atmospheric glow. The sculk sensor is a redstone block that detects vibrations, so walk carefully or use a wool block to muffle your steps. The sculk catalyst spreads sculk around it and sculk veins generate around patches of sculk that spawn from the sculk catalyst. Finally, the sculk shrieker is possibly the most dangerous block of all since it will summon the warden if you’re not careful!

## **Recovery Compass and Echo Shards**

-   The recovery compass is the solution for finding the way back to the last location you died. Loot chests in ancient cities to discover echo shards and craft one for yourself!

## **Mangrove Swamp Biome**

-   Towering trees, wide roots, small saplings, and muddy terrain make up the new mangrove swamps. Found in areas with high temperatures and high humidity, this new swamp also introduces mangrove trees and mud blocks, bringing a wide range of new materials to craft builds inspired by the beauty of the Overworld!

## **Mangrove Trees/Wood**

-   Mangrove trees introduce a brand-new type of wood block to build with, the logs can be crafted into planks, stairs, buttons, slabs, fences, doors, signs, and pressure plates. You can also craft with the mangrove tree’s leaves, roots, and small saplings called propagules!

## **Mud Blocks**

-   Mud can be found all over mangrove swamps and crafted with wheat into packed mud! Use it to craft a variety of mud brick blocks including stairs, slabs, and walls. This block is also renewable by using a water bottle on dirt, so there is no risk of running out of mud. Placing Mud above a block that has pointed dripstone underneath will eventually turn the mud block into clay!

## **Frogs and Tadpoles**

-   Frogs feed on small slimes, breathe on land and in water, and lay eggs called frogspawn. The eggs will hatch and turn into tadpoles, making this the first mob that isn’t bred from a smaller version of itself! There are three different types to discover – temperate frogs, warm frogs, and cold frogs – so getting your hands on all three means that you will need to travel through the Overworld!

## **Froglight Blocks**

-   These luminous blocks come in three different variants depending on which frog type produces it. If you want to light up your base with ochre, verdant, or pearlescent froglights, you will need to figure out a way to feed a frog a very small magma cube!

## **Allay**

-   The winner of the Minecraft Live 2021 Mob Vote is flying into Minecraft! Instantly recognizable by its luminous blue sheen, you won’t lose this mob once you find it. Hand it an item and it will pick up matching items it finds in the world. It loves music and will drop items if it hears a note block playing nearby. The allay spawns in pillager outposts and woodland mansions and is waiting for you to set it free!

## **Boat in Chest**

-   The Wild Update makes it possible for you to craft a boat with a chest on it, which is convenient since there are plenty of new blocks to bring back from your new adventures!

## **Goat Horn**

-   Dropped by goats that ram into hard blocks and can be used to make a variety of sounds! Can you find all eight variants?

## **New Music**

-   Added new music by Lena Raine and Samuel Åberg
-   Music Disc 5
    -   Unlike other discs, it can only be obtained by finding and crafting nine disc fragments together
    -   These disc fragments can be found rarely in ancient city chests
-   Mobile players: To hear the new music, you will need to download the updated Minecraft Original Music Pack, available FREE from Marketplace

## **New Achievements**

-   It Spreads - Kill a mob next to a catalyst
-   Birthday Song - Have an Allay drop a cake at a note block
-   With Our Powers Combined! - Have all 3 froglights in your inventory
-   Sneak 100 - Sneaking next to a Sculk Sensor without triggering it

## **Spectator Mode (Experimental):**

Our initial implementation of Spectator Mode will not include every feature available in the Java Edition (such as "mob view", speed control, etc.), we have chosen to focus on the parts of spectator mode that we hope will be most useful. We would like to hear about bugs you have found with the features that are included currently, and you may now report these at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/) if they have not been reported already. Any additional parity breaks, feature requests, or suggestions for what to add next should be made through [feedback.minecraft.net](https://feedback.minecraft.net/).  
  

## **What’s Currently in Scope**

## **Enabling and Disabling**

Players can switch to and from Spectator using the Settings Menu and the '/gamemode spectator' command, if cheats are enabled. Player inventory, health, held items etc are unchanged when switching into spectator mode and then out again

## **Movement**

-   Spectators are always flying and cannot become grounded
    -   (For this version we will not attempt movement parity with Java edition, but may do more in this area later)

## **World Interactions**

-   Spectators pass through solid blocks and entities without any collisions
-   Spectators can see out of solid objects
-   Spectators are not affected by any in-game blocks, mobs, items, portals, or effects and cannot take damage
-   Portals currently affect spectators, but this is a bug we intend to fix in the future
-   Spectators cannot use items or interact with blocks or mobs (for example, they cannot attack, feed, mount, or trade with mobs)
-   Spectators cannot open their inventory or interact with block UIs like chests (This is not in parity with Java yet)
    -   Currently spectators that die drop their inventory, this is a known issue that we want to address

## **User Interface**

-   Spectators have a reduced HUD that does not show the crosshair, hotbar, XP, health, hunger or armor

## **Visibility and Rendering**

-   Spectators cannot be seen by mobs or other players except other spectators
-   Spectators appear as a transparent floating head (to those who can see them). The body, arms, legs, armor and held items are not rendered.
    -   Currently the transparency does not work correctly for all skin selection types, this is a known issue
-   When playing in first person, spectators do not see their arm or held item

## **Technical**

-   Spectators generate chunks as normal (This is not in parity with Java yet)
-   Spectators don't cause mobs to spawn

## **Spectator Bug Fixes:**
