-   Initial APIs are releasing out of beta and will be usable without an experimental flag
-   The first module to release is _@minecraft/server_ as version 1.0.0. The APIs included with this are listed below:
    -   Non-beta APIs like those included in the _@minecraft/server_0.0 module do not require the Beta APIs experiment to be turned on, and will be more stable over time
    -   This initial API set is narrow, but we intend to add more APIs into non-beta modules over the coming months
-   _@minecraft/server_ will continue to develop in Beta and those Beta APIs have been incremented in version to 1.1.0-beta; if you wish to continue to use Beta _@minecraft/server_ APIs, manifest.json references will need to be updated to 1.1.0-beta
