## **New Features:**

## **Spectator Mode**

Spectator Mode has made its way into Minecraft: Bedrock Edition! This feature has been experimental for a little while but has now made its way into the game with no experimental toggle required. Here’s a quick write up of this new game mode and how it can be used:

-   When cheats are enabled, players can go in and out of Spectator Mode using the Personal Game Mode option in World Settings or the '/gamemode spectator' command
-   Spectators have a reduced HUD that does not show the crosshair, hotbar, XP, health, hunger, or armor
-   Players’ inventory, health, held items, etc, are unchanged when switching in and out of Spectator Mode
-   Spectators are always flying and cannot be grounded
-   Spectators pass through solid blocks and entities without collision
-   Spectators can see out of solid objects when inside blocks
-   Spectators cannot take damage and are not affected by any blocks, mobs, items, portals, or effects
-   Spectators cannot use items or interact with blocks or mobs
-   Spectators cannot open their inventory or interact with block screens, like Chests or Furnaces
-   Spectators cannot be seen by mobs or other players, except other players in Spectator Mode
    -   Spectators appear as a transparent floating head to other players in Spectator Mode
-   Spectators are not needed to sleep to pass the night
-   When playing in first person perspective, spectators do not see their arm or held item
-   Spectators generate chunks, if they fly to new chunks
-   Spectators do not spawn any mobs
-   Non-persistent mobs around spectators will check for distance to any non-spectators when deciding if they should despawn
-   Commands can select and act on spectators
