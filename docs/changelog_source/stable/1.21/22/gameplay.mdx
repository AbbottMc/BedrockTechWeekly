A new update has been released to address a few issues with the 1.21.20 release. Some platforms have received the update and other platforms will get the update as it is approved.  
  

# **Fixes:**

-   Fixed several crashes that could occur during gameplay
-   Improved loading of add-ons from Marketplace
-   Fixed a bug where all custom blocks were rotated 180 degrees in the UI
    -   The default for the "gui" "item\_display\_transforms" "rotation" field is \`\[30, 45, 0\]\` instead of \`\[30, 225, 0\]\`  
             "item\_display\_transforms": \{  
                  "gui" : \{  
                       "translation": \[0, 0, 0\],  
                       "rotation": \[30, 45, 0\],  
                       "scale": \[0.625, 0.625, 0.625\],  
                        "rotation\_pivot": \[0, 0, 0\],  
                       "scale\_pivot": \[0, 0, 0\],  
                       "fit\_to\_frame": true  
                  \}  
             \}
