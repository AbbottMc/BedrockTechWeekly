**Posted:** 3 December 2024

Shh! I'm writing this changelog from behind a pale oak tree - and I have to be _very quiet_ because the Garden Awakens drop is finally here - and creakings are spawning in pale gardens all across the Overworld! The Garden Awakens brings with it an eerie biome - the pale garden - which is carpeted in moss, filled with pale oak trees, and home to a unique flower called an eyeblossom. It also brings a watchful hostile mob, the creaking, as well as the secret to defeating (and spawning) it - the creaking heart! Facing up to a creaking will also earn you resin clumps - another new block you can craft into resin bricks, or use to trim your armor. Was that everything? Oh! And we've also made some bug fixes. Now, let me see if I can back away slowly without this creaking spotting me...

![The Garden Awakens update in Minecraft](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/32375754540429)

# New Features

# Gameplay Drop

-   Added Pale Garden Biome, Pale Oak tree, Pale Moss block, Pale Moss carpet, Pale Hanging Moss and Pale Oak wood set
-   Added Creaking mob, Creaking Spawn Egg and Creaking Heart block

### Creaking Heart

A Creaking Heart is a "living" block generating in Pale Oak trees, covered on all sides by Pale Oak wood logs. It can spawn a Creaking mob when it is night time, and it is placed between two correctly aligned Pale Oak log blocks.

-   Is active during night and dormant during day
    
-   Sends a trail of particles towards the connected Creaking when the Creaking gets hit by the player
    
-   When Creaking Heart block is destroyed, the connected Creaking is removed
    
-   Creaking Heart cannot be moved by Pistons
    
-   Creaking Heart cannot be used as fuel
    
-   Creaking Heart spawning and despawning its Creaking emits vibrations from the Creaking's position
    
-   Naturally generated Creaking Hearts drop 20 to 24 experience, even when collected with Silk Touch
    

### Creaking Mob

The Creaking mob spawns at night in the Pale Garden biome if there is a Creaking Heart block that has been generated in a Pale Oak tree. Gameplay features:

-   An activated Creaking will not move if a player is looking at it
    
-   Creaking is invulnerable to damage
    
-   When hit, a particle trail is shown between the Creaking and the Creaking Heart block it is connected to
    
-   When the Creaking Heart block the Creaking is connected to is destroyed, the Creaking is removed
    
-   Is not affected by light levels but spawns and despawns based on day/night cycle
    
-   Creaking cannot enter Boats
    
-   Creaking spawned from a Creaking Heart cannot go through portals
    
-   The Creaking Spawn Egg will spawn a Creaking mob that is not connected to a Creaking Heart. The Creaking mob will persist through day and night, loads and saves, and will take damage from attacks and other damage sources. It has one point of health (half a heart)
    
-   Creaking summoned from the Creaking Heart cannot be spawned with a spawn egg, nor can it be summoned with commands. It can only exist as a part of the Creaking Heart block
    
-   Player wearing a carved pumpkin on their head can look at Creaking without it freezing in place
    
-   When a Creaking Heart is destroyed, its Creaking will twitch for a few seconds before crumbling
    
-   Creakings spawned by a Creaking Heart will crumble when stuck in a hole with a Player for more than 5 seconds
    
    -   This prevents a potential soft lock, as the invulnerable Creaking would prevent the player from mining or placing any blocks, requiring them to exit and re-enter the world to force the Creaking to despawn
-   A Creaking crumbling causes nearby Sculk Catalysts to bloom
    
    -   However, no Sculk will be placed since the Creaking does not drop any XP
-   Creaking plays 4 different sway sounds
    
-   Creaking plays new attack sounds
    

## Eyeblossom

Eyeblossoms are new flowers that generate in the Pale Garden biome. Unique features:

-   They exist in two variants: Closed and Open Eyeblossom
-   Eyeblossoms transition between the two variants based on the time of day
    -   During the night, Eyeblossoms will become Open
    -   During the day, they will become Closed
    -   In dimensions that do not have a day/night cycle, they will remain as-is
-   Eyeblossoms planted on the ground will communicate with each other, helping each other to open or close
-   Open Eyeblossoms have glowing eyes during the night
-   Eyeblossoms can be obtained by bonemealing the grass in the Pale Garden biome
-   Bees get poisoned when they interact with Eyeblossoms
-   Suspicious Stew made from Eyeblossom will have Blindness or Nausea effect depending on the variant

-   Eyeblossoms play sounds when opening and closing
-   Open Eyeblossoms emit ambient sounds when placed on a Pale Moss Block
-   Open and Closed Eyeblossoms can now be used on Mooshrooms to obtain their respective Suspicious Stews when milking ([MCPE-187754](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187754))

### New system for Pale Garden ambient sounds

Ambient sounds in the Pale Garden biome do not come from the biome settings but are generated by blocks found in the biome

-   Pale Hanging Moss emits subtle atmospheric sounds when it is attached to Pale Oak Logs and Pale Oak Leaves
-   Creaking Heart block emits a set of eerie sounds when it is active during night and surrounded by Logs on all sides

## Blocks & Items

\> **Developer's Note**: We've fixed several issues where the tool used to mine some blocks didn't affect the drop or mining speed correctly. Related to these changes, any block that drops when its support is broken will also drop when mined with any tool.

-   Swords no longer mine all blocks faster than bare hands, instead doing that only for some plant-type blocks that aren't already insta-minable, such as Leaves, Pumpkins, Big Dripleaf, Chorus Flower, Chorus Plant, Cocoa, Glow Lichen, Melon Block, Moss Carpet, and Vines ([MCPE-93323](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-93323))
    
-   Stone Button and Polished Blackstone Button no longer require a Pickaxe to drop, and are now faster to mine with any improper tool ([MCPE-162158](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-162158))
    
-   Updated Heavy Core's item texture
    
-   The following blocks now only drop when broken with a pickaxe: Blast Furnace, Cauldron, Dispenser, Dropper, Enchanting Table, Furnace, Hopper, and Smoker ([MCPE-33950](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-33950))
    
-   The following blocks that require support now always drop when broken with any tool: all Copper Doors, Iron Door, Heavy Weighted Pressure Plate, Light Weighted Pressure Plate, Polished Blackstone Pressure Plate, and Stone Pressure Plate
    
-   Budding Amethyst is now slower to mine with an improper tool
    
-   The following blocks (which always drop) are now mined faster when using the incorrect tool: Bell, Brewing Stand, Crafter, Ender Chest, Lantern, and Soul Lantern. Note that the Ender Chest is considered an 'always drops block' even though the drop is not an Ender Chest ([MCPE-176374](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-176374))

## Features

-   Standardized the blocks that trees can replace when growing, with a few exceptions ([MCPE-187302](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187302)) ([MCPE-187301](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187301))
    
    -   All trees can now grow through leaves, with the exception of Cherry trees cannot grow through their own leaves ([MCPE-168029](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-168029))

-   The following feature types are now unable to place internal-only features
    
    -   `minecraft:aggregate_feature`
    -   `minecraft:snap_to_surface_feature`
    -   `minecraft:surface_relative_threshold_feature`
    -   `minecraft:weighted_random_feature`

## Gameplay

-   There is now a warning message when you are prevented from entering an unloaded chunk
    
-   Now the respiration enchantment reduces the chance of taking drowning damage ([MCPE-46922](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-46922))
    
-   Players can no longer earn achievements or trophies after dying and respawning as a spectator in hardcore mode
    
-   Mace damage now scales with distance fallen when it is used by mobs
    
-   Players will keep their inventory after dying on Easy and Peaceful as we're testing ways to adapt our difficulty levels. Your feedback is greatly appreciated on [this page](https://aka.ms/mckeepinventoryfeedback)
    
    -   _Please note: We're testing new difficulty levels, so some players will keep their inventory after dying on Easy and Peaceful. If this happens to you, don't worry—it's not a bug._
-   The kill command or any damage greater or equal to the target's current life will now kill it in base game versions below 1.18.20
    
-   Zombified Piglins spawned by Nether Portals now have a 15-second cooldown before they can use the Portal again
    
-   Using an empty Bundle now causes an animation to play in both first and third person
    
-   Second passenger in a Boat or Camel will now also have the warning message when hitting unloaded chunk.

-   Holding the jump button when falling on a Slime Block no longer cancels the bounce ([MCPE-185354](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-185354))
    
-   Sneaking while landing on a Slime Block no longer causes fall damage
    

\> **Developer's Note:** The intended way to stop bouncing on a Slime Block is now to sneak. Previously players could stop bouncing by holding the jump button, but this was an unintentional oversight that worked since the jump effectively cancelled out the movement from the block. This caused other types of bugs such as when hitting a mob with a Mace with Wind Charge enchantment while holding the jump button. The new player jump behaviour is to always pick the highest between existing vertical velocity and jump velocity.

-   Fixed one case where blocks would fail to place if a player would place a block and then change their selected slot before the server handled the block placement. This would reject the block placement because the server didn't expect the slot to change ([MCPE-112420](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-112420))
    
-   Blackstone can now be used to repair stone tools and stone weapons ([MCPE-71859](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-71859))
    
-   Fixed clients sometimes not matching the servers rain/snow weather state ([MCPE-131325](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-131325))
    

## General

-   Player spawn algorithm has been improved so it is more difficult to spawn in water or powder snow. ([MCPE-120237](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-120237))
    

## Graphical

-   Textures with multiple variations will now load PBR texture data. ([MCPE-174191](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-174191))
    
-   Removed the unintended darker tinting of Kelp ([MCPE-169713](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-169713))
    
-   Sky color now gradually transitions when traveling between different biomes, rather than changing abruptly ([MCPE-90625](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-90625))

-   Magma Cube model part UVs no longer overlap each other
    

### Wither

-   The spawn and death animations smoothly transition it between a white color overlay and its normal textures ([MCPE-64537](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-64537))
    
-   The Wither will no longer move during its spawning animation ([MCPE-48265](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-48265))
    
-   The Wither's heads now look at their target more consistently ([MCPE-32826](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-32826))
