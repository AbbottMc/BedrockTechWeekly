In this week’s changelog, villagers can finally sleep soundly, foxes are getting a parity change, and we’ve got bundles of information about – bundles, which are now available as an experimental feature for all Bedrock players! Villagers will no longer make idle sounds when sleeping (they’re asleep, after all!) and adorable foxes across the Overworld will be waking up with the same amount of health (10!) as their Java counterparts. If that wasn’t enough we’ve also implemented some bug fixes, made parity changes, and more.

Your thoughts on the game continue to shape new updates so please upvote and report any new bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com) and leave us your feedback at [feedback.minecraft.net](https://feedback.minecraft.net/).

# Experimental Features

## Bundles

A Bundle is an item that lets you stack different blocks or items together in the same inventory slot. Different items normally don’t stack together, so you can end up wasting space by only having a few items in each slot. A Bundle lets you pack those items together so there is no wasted space.

-   Bundles are an experimental feature - to use them, you must turn on the Bundle experiment when creating a new world
    
    -   Please note: Bundles are still being polished in the Preview and Betas with bug fixes and tweaks, so you might spot some slight differences in this experimental version!
-   A Bundle is an item that can pack different items together into the same stack
    
-   A Bundle only fits one stack (usually 64 items) but it can be a mixture of many different item types
    
-   You can insert items into a Bundle directly in the inventory
    
-   Bundles have a tooltip that shows the items inside
    
    -   The tooltip fits 3 rows and can always show at least 8 item types
-   You can select any of the visible items to pull out of the Bundle
    
    -   Use the scroll wheel on mouse, the right stick on a game controller, or tap on a touch device
-   When selecting an item to remove, the Bundle icon shows that item poking out of the Bundle
    
-   When holding a Bundle in hand, you can empty it onto the ground
    
    -   In the latest Beta & Preview version, when a Bundle is used in the hotbar, one group of items is emptied at a time instead of everything being emptied at once
-   The Bundle is crafted with one String above one Leather
    
-   Bundle recipe is now unlocked by obtaining Leather or String
    
-   **Known Issues:**
    
    -   When moving items on touch devices, the wrong item icon may appear briefly
    -   Bundles put in Decorated Pots, given to an Allay, or moved through Hoppers and Droppers may lose their contents

# Features and Bug Fixes

## Blocks

-   Vertically retracting waterlogged blocks with a Piston no longer creates "ghost water" on the client ([MCPE-144222](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-144222))
    
-   "purpur\_block" block is now split into unique instances "purpur\_block", and "purpur\_pillar"; the previously unused chiseled and smooth purpur blocks were renamed to "deprecated\_purpur\_block\_1" and "deprecated\_purpur\_block\_2" for backwards compatibility, but are hidden from creative inventory and commands

After you receive the final update, you will still receive updates on your PlayStation® and be able to play without PlayStation®VR. From this point on you can keep building in your worlds, and your Marketplace purchases (including Tokens) will continue to be available. You will no longer be able to use your PlayStation®VR with Minecraft as it will no longer be supported in the latest updates.

## Rarity

-   Various items and blocks have had their assigned rarities changed ([MCPE-182414](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-182414))
    -   Once these rarity changes come to Java Edition in a future snapshot, all item and block rarities will be in parity across both platforms
-   Rarity is a set of categories which determine the color used to display the name of an item or block
    -   It has no gameplay impact, but is used to signal how difficult something is to obtain
    -   By default, unless specified otherwise, all items and blocks have a rarity of Common which displays their name in the color white
-   We have re-evaluated the rarity of all items and blocks in the game to more accurately reflect the current challenge of obtaining them, given the following guidelines:
    -   Items and blocks become more rare depending on the following factors:
        -   The chance of finding it in a loot table, including mob drops
        -   The amount of travelling required to obtain it
        -   The difficulty of any obstacle which must be overcome to obtain it
        -   The possible amount of that item or block which exists in the world
    -   Any item or block which can be crafted must inherit the highest rarity of its crafting ingredients
        -   For example, a Mace has an Epic rarity because one of its ingredients (the Heavy Core) has an Epic rarity
        -   Likewise, any crafted item which has only Common crafting ingredients must also be Common
-   The lists below detail the items and blocks which have changed to that rarity category

### Common

-   End Crystal
-   Golden Apple

### Epic

-   Elytra
-   Dragon Head
-   Silence Armor Trim

### Rare

-   Enchanted Golden Apple
    -   Enchanted Golden Apples have become more common in recent years due to being accessible in both Ancient Cities and Trial Chambers, warranting a demotion to Rare instead of Epic
-   Trident
    -   We recently increased Trident's rarity up to Epic from Common, but after re-evaluating we felt that it was easier to obtain than other items in the Epic category such as Heavy Cores or Elytra
-   Nether Star
-   Ward Armor Trim
-   Eye Armor Trim
-   Vex Armor Trim
-   Spire Armor Trim
-   Wither Skeleton Skull

-   The following Music Discs:
    -   Pigstep
