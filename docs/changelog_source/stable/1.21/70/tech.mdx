    -   All methods for Vector.
-   Changed spawnEntity method on Dimension to now take a variant of either a string or EntityType.
    
-   Added placeFeature and placeFeatureRule APIs to the Dimension class
    
-   Added isValid property to the Camera class.
    

### Biomes

-   Fix client\_biome loading so grass\_appearance and foliage\_appearance settings are added if not specified when format\_version is lower than 1.21.60 ([MCPE-189816](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-189816))

### Blocks

-   water and lava no longer will turn into flowing\_water or flowing\_lava when neighbor updates happen. water and lava now will respond to queued ticks without needing to change into another block
    
-   "minecraft:material\_instances" component has a new experimental boolean field "isotropic" for format version **1.21.70** and higher, this field controls rotating the face UVs randomly based on BlockPos
    
-   Empty Bell blocks no longer crash the game when moved by a sticky piston JIRA: ([MCPE-188687](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-188687))
    
-   Updated the /fill, /clear and /testforblock Commands
    
    -   Fixed a bug where these commands would recognize IDs of some flattened blocks as block group names and affect all variants under those groups
-   Add dry\_foliage tint method which uses the textures/colormap/dry\_foliage.png color map
    

### Commands

-   Moved the place feature and place featurerule subcommands out of the Upcoming Creator Features experiment
    
-   Removed set\_movement\_authority command.
    

### Components

-   Added the 'minecraft:replaceable' component which determines if a new block can replace the existing block at a particular position. If the component is not added to a block it is not replaceable.
    
-   Multiple components that used effect durations can now be set to "infinite" including:
    
    -   "minecraft:attack": "effect\_duration"
    -   "minecraft:healable": "duration" in the "effects" list
    -   "minecraft:mob\_effect": "effect\_time"
    -   "minecraft:projectile": "durationeasy", "durationnormal", and "durationhard" can now all use "infinite"
    -   "minecraft:food": "duration" in the "effects" list
    -   "minecraft:spell\_effects": "duration" in the "add\_effects" list
    -   "minecraft:combat\_regeneration": "regeneration\_duration"
-   Added the "minecraft:is\_collidable" component
    
    -   This component allows other mobs to have vertical and horizontal collisions with the component's owner
        -   For a collision to occur, both mobs must have a "minecraft:collision\_box" component
        -   This component can only be used on mobs and enables collisions exclusively between mobs
    -   Please note that this type of collision is unreliable for moving mobs
        -   It is recommended to use this component only in scenarios where the mob remains stationary
    -   Collidable behavior is closely related to stackable behavior
        -   While the "minecraft:is\_collidable" component governs how other mobs interact with the component's owner, the "minecraft:is\_stackable" component describes how an entity interacts with others of its own kind
-   The "entity\_sensor" component now has two additional fields:
    
    -   "y\_offset", applies a vertical offset to the entity's position when calculating distances to other entities
    -   "find\_players\_only", restricts the search to Players only, affecting all subsensors
-   Added the "minecraft:body\_rotation\_axis\_aligned" component, that causes the entity's body to automatically rotate to align with the nearest cardinal direction based on its current facing direction
    
    -   Combining this with the "minecraft:body\_rotation\_blocked" component will cause the entity to align to the nearest cardinal direction and remain fixed in that orientation, regardless of future changes in its facing direction
-   Added validation for asset references in components
    
    -   Content errors will log missing references for the following fields:
        -   item references
        -   block reference in item component in "minecraft:block\_placer"
        -   loot table reference in block component "minecraft:loot"
-   The "entity\_sensor" component's "find\_players\_only" field now functions correctly, properly restricting searches to Players only and affecting all subsensors
    
-   Added the "minecraft:input\_air\_controlled" component, that enables controlling flying rideables
    
    -   Functions similarly to "minecraft:input\_ground\_controlled", but instead of limiting acceleration to the XZ-plane, this component applies acceleration in the direction the player is looking in three dimensions
    -   Supports adjustments to strafing and backward movement speeds, allowing entities to fly at equal speeds in all directions or move slower when strafing or reversing
    -   This component is experimental and as such requires "use\_beta\_features" to be enabled
    -   It may undergo significant changes or even be replaced as development progresses

### Creator

-   ItemTag support in the match\_tool loot table condition no longer requires enabling the "Upcoming Creator Features" experiment toggle

### Data-driven Jigsaw Structures

-   Fixed placement of Jigsaw structures that contain blocks with minecraft:tick component.

### Dedicated Server

-   Exposed two new parameters for dedicated server when in server-auth-with-rewind. These will make the server more strict on player positions. Look in server.properties for more information on what these do.
    
    -   server-authoritative-movement-strict default to false and can be set to true. Will affect Player position acceptance
    -   server-authoritative-dismount-strict default to false and can be set to true. Will affect Player position when dismounting
-   Exposed a new parameter for dedicated server. This will make the server more strict on entity interactions. Look in server.properties for more information on what these do.
    
    -   server-authoritative-entity-interactions-strict default to false and can be set to true. Will affect Entity interaction acceptance
-   Removed server-authoritative-movement parameter. It will now always use server-auth-with-rewind.
    

### Editor

We are excited to announce Editor v0.9! To learn more about Editor and its multiblock world editing capabilities, check out the documents [HERE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/bedrockeditor/?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable), or learn how to build an Editor Extension [HERE](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor)

## Feature Highlights in Editor v0.9

### Realms Integration

You can now publish your Editor Project directly to Realms, making it simple to play or test your world on any device. Need to tweak something? You can also download your Realms world back into the Editor for further edits. Just make sure youâ€™re signed in with an active Realms subscription.

### Grid Repeat

Grid Repeat is a new mode within the Repeater Tool which allows you to effortlessly repeat a selection in the x, y, and z directions, making tasks like adding windows to a building or creating an entire city a breeze. The Grid Repeat feature includes both Uniform and Separate repeat types, allowing you to customize the number of instances repeated in all directions.

### Updated Structure Management

We have updated the Structure feature to provide better management of your structures. You can now rename, delete, and duplicate structures with ease. Additionally, you can rename the file/unique name and change the namespace for more precise organization. Please note that project structures will be exported to the editor/structuredb subdirectory in the world folder.

### Multiblock Workbench

We have updated the Workbench Tool to work with multiple blocks of the same type. Simply select the blocks you want to manipulate and then go to the Workbench Tool.

### Block and Entity Inspector

Block and Entity Inspector allow you to view block states and entities and then customize specific properties. This is incredibly useful to fine tune details.

-   Added particle\_item\_name map to particle\_on\_hit on hit sub-component, maps an item name to an actor filter to determine what the name of the item used in the particle should be. Falls back to the name of the entity itself as before.

### Entity Event Responses

-   Added the "stop\_movement" entity event response, which stops the entity's movement
    
    -   The "stop\_vertical\_movement" field specifies whether vertical movement should be stopped
    -   The "stop\_horizontal\_movement" field specifies whether horizontal movement should be stopped
    -   This response does not stop navigation or prevent future movement
        -   If that's the desired outcome, also remove the components responsible for that
-   Added the "set\_home\_position" entity event response, which sets the entity's home position to its current position
    
    -   For this to have any effect, the entity must already have a "minecraft:home" component

### Entity Events

### General

-   Fixed issue that occurs when cancelling world resource pack download.
    
-   Fixed crash that occurs when initializing minecraft:decorated\_pot renderer.
    
-   Server Authoritative movement is now turned on by default.
    

### Goals

-   "minecraft:behavior.float\_wander" AI goal will now restrict mobs to their home position if they have the "minecraft:home" component
    
-   Added "use\_home\_position\_restriction" field to "minecraft:behavior.float\_wander" AI goal to control whether mobs respect home position restrictions when selecting target positions
    
    -   Defaults to false for entities with format version below 1.21.70, and true for 1.21.70 and later
    -   When true, the mob will respect home position restrictions when selecting target positions

### Jigsaw

-   Fixed world\_surface type of heightmap\_projection in minecraft:jigsaw to generate on top of water and leaf blocks.
    
-   Fixed gaps from appearing between data-driven jigsaw structure pieces.
    

### JSON Events

-   The parameter "duration" in the "add\_mob\_effect" event can now be set to "infinite"

### Mobs

-   Added maximum value of 100000000.0 and minimum value of \-100000000.0 to **"minecraft:collision\_box"** component
    
-   Added aquatic family-type for all aquatic mobs
    
-   Normal Minecart is no longer considered a mob
    

### Network Protocol

-   Added ActorFlags::COLLIDABLE
-   Added ActorFlags::BODY\_ROTATION\_AXIS\_ALIGNED
-   Added ActorFlags::WASD\_AIR\_CONTROLLED

### Particles

-   Multiple controllers transitioning out of a state at the same time will now properly expire all intended particles instead of just the last one

### Sounds

-   Added support for entity sound variants
    
    -   Entity sounds now have a "variants" field which defines sound variants based on the runtime entity
    -   Variants has a "key" field reading a Molang expression returning a string to select sound variant (eg: querying an enum entity property).
    -   Variants has a "map" field which contains key-value pairs of a variant identifier and the sound events it overrides.
    -   When playing a sound for an entity we first try to calculate their variant and see if that variant overrides the sound event, if not we play the sound form the base entity. If that fails we fall back to the existing logic of running from "defaults". Example: Given a mob with the following property

    "minecraft:emotional_state": \{  "type": "enum",  "values": [ "neutral", "angry", "happy", "sad" ],  "default": "neutral",  "client_sync": true\}

Sound variants can be played by querying the property:

    \{  "entity_sounds": \{    "entities": \{      "test_mob": \{        "volume": 1.0,        "pitch": 1.0,        // The base sounds for various events        "events": \{          "ambient": "mob.test_mob.ambient",          "death": "mob.test_mob.death",          "step": \{            "sound": "mob.test_mob.step",            "volume": 0.8,            "pitch": 1.0          \},          "attack": "mob.test_mob.attack"        \},        "variants": \{            // Key returning the enum string for variants, can use any Molang expression resulting in a string            "key": "query.property('minecraft:emotional_state')",            "map": \{              // If a resulting variant key is not handled here then it will use the base sounds              "neutral": \{                "volume": 1.0,                "pitch": 1.0,                "events": \{                  // If an event is not handled in a variant then it will use the base sound                  "death": "mob.test_mob.death.netural"                \}              \},              "angry": \{                "volume": 1.0,                "pitch": 1.0,                "events": \{                  // Variants can override different events than other variants                  "death": "mob.test_mob.death.angry",                  "ambient": "mob.test_mob.ambient.angry"                \}              \}            \}          \}        \}      \}    \}  \}\}

-   Sound effects found in animations and animation controllers can now include an optional "locator" field similar to particle effects allowing them to originate from the locator on the entity rather than the origin

### Structures

-   Fixed mirroring and rotation of crafter blocks when part of a structure that is being placed:




<h2 className="experimental_divider">å®žéªŒæ€§ç‰¹æ€§</h2>

    -   registerAsync function can now be called in early execution
-   Fixed a bug where the typeid property of the Effect class was being translated based on your language option.
    
-   Raised the limit for Lore Entry length from 50 to 1000 and the number of lines from 20 to 100 when using ItemStack.setLore
    
-   Added three new methods to Player . These Entity Overrides are only applied to the target Player. Changes are not applied until the next tick and will not apply to other players.
    
    -   setPropertyOverrideForEntity: Overrides an Entity Property on the target Entity to the provided value. This property must be client synced.
    -   removePropertyOverrideForEntity: Removes the override of the specified Entity Property on the target Entity.
    -   clearPropertyOverridesForEntity: Removes all overrides of any Entity Properties on the target Entity.

### API - Molang

-   Added query.graphics\_mode\_is\_any to Molang which accepts any of the following parameters: simple, fancy, deferred, raytraced. These parameters are all graphics modes that are available in the settings menu.

### Blocks

-   The minecraft:map\_color component underwent a schema change
    
    -   It is now a JSON object with two fields "color" and "tint\_method".
    -   "color" is a required string field expecting an HEX representation of the RGB, prefixed with a # character.
    -   "tint\_method" is a string field that multiplies the color with a predefined tint. Supported values are "none, "default\_foliage", "birch\_foliage", "evergreen\_foliage", "dry\_foliage", "grass" and "water".
    -   the old schema format is still supported for convenience. Examples:
        
            "minecraft:map_color": \{  "color": "#ABCDEF",  "tint_method": "grass"\}
        
        or
        
            "minecraft:map_color": \{  "color": "#ABCDEF"\}
        
        or
        
            "minecraft:map_color": "#ABCDEF"
        
-   -   The minecraft:material\_instances component supports an optional "tint\_method" field in its instance definitions
        
        -   "tint\_method" is a string field that multiplies a face color with a tint computed with the biome the block is in. Supported values are "none, "default\_foliage", "birch\_foliage", "evergreen\_foliage", "dry\_foliage", "grass", and "water".
        -   Held block-items are tinted as if they were in the "plains" biome. Example:
    
              "*": \{          "texture": "minimal",          "render_method": "opaque",     "tint_method": "water"      \}
    
-   Exposed the Block component minecraft:destruction\_particles as a JSON object. This represents the particles used when the Block is destroyed
    
    -   There is two fields for it:
    -   "texture" is a required string field to set the texture used by the particles
    -   "tint\_method" is an optional string field that multiplies the texture color with a predefined tint. Default to "none". Supported values are "none", "default\_foliage", "birch\_foliage", "evergreen\_foliage", "dry\_foliage", "grass" and "water".
    -   Block format before 1.21.70 will be upgraded to have the component added using the texture from the "down" or "\*" of the minecraft:material\_instances component if present and "none" for tint\_method. This was the old behavior.
    -   Block format from 1.21.70 without the component will not be upgraded and uses the invalid texture  
        Examples:
        
             "minecraft:destruction_particles": \{  "texture": "my_particles_texture",  "tint_method": "grass" \}
        
        or
        
            "minecraft:destruction_particles": \{ "texture": "my_particles_texture"\}
        

### Experimental

-   Removed the Experimental Third Person Cameras toggle and added an Experimental Creator Camera Features toggle for all future experimental cameras

### General

-   Removed unused experimental json field peaks\_factor from minecraft:mountain\_parameters in the behavior pack biome file
