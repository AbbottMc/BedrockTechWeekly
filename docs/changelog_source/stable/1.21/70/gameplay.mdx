### General

-   In Server Authoritative movement, when Players receive a movement correction it will use the current Player speed instead of a generic one, this should give a better experience.

### Mobs

-   Foxes now take damage from lava, and not only fire ([MCPE-56926](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-56926))
-   In the 1.21.80.21 Preview changelog we mentioned that mobs related to [MCPE-190466](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-190466) will be unaffected in this release. We have made every effort to make sure of this, but there's a possibility that these mobs may become invisible after the update.
