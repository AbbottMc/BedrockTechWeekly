Hold on tight, because this changelog is quite a pig deal! Not only do have we fixed a bunch of bugs, there are also several features available in the experimental toggle. Meet the two new pig variants trotting into the Overworld, make leaves fall from trees, and get a simpler recipe for the lodestone so you can find your way back home more easily. Just enable the Drop 1 2025 experimental toggle to test these out!

Your thoughts on the game continue to shape new updates so please upvote and report any new bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/) and leave us your feedback at [feedback.minecraft.net](https://feedback.minecraft.net/).

#### Pause Feature

-   The pause functionality will only be available in Beta and Preview for the time being. We know you're super excited to be able to pause in Bedrock. However, we need a bit more time to perfect this feature before we can release it to you. Thanks for your patience and understanding as we work to bring you the best possible experience.
    -   We'd love to know what you think of this feature, so please continue to test it in Beta and Preview and send us your feedback at [aka.ms/mcbedrockpausefeedback](https://aka.ms/mcbedrockpausefeedback)

## General

-   The world spawn point algorithm has been improved, so that locations with good biomes but far from the world's origin are preferred over really bad locations but closer to the origin ([MCPE-120237](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-120237))
    
-   Filter Profanity Toggle. We are introducing a new "Filter Profanity" setting on Windows. When on, all text content including chat will perform as it always has; profanities will be filtered for you and others. When off, most profanities, with the exception of some potentially harmful content, will be unfiltered for you and all others who also have the toggle off. The setting is default on for all players and cannot be changed for child accounts or players not signed in. You can toggle it off in Settings under "General".

-   Creakings spawned by a Creaking Heart can now be nametagged, preventing them from despawning during the day
    
    -   Destroying their Creaking Heart will still cause them to crumble
    -   Hitting a nametagged Creaking during the day will result in a particle trail, but no Resin
-   The Creaking can now spawn when the moon starts rising, and crumbles when the moon has completely set
    
-   Fixed issue preventing Squid from rotating to match their movement
    
-   Fixed an issue to prevent Enderman from teleporting when riding Boats and Minecarts ([MCPE-31761](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-31761))
    

### Magma Cube

-   The new Magma Cube model and texture are now only used by Resource Packs that explicitly override them, as they have been renamed to differentiate them from the original assets ([MCPE-188547](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-188547))
    
    -   This change is retroactive, starting from version 1.21.50

-   From new Play screen users can now access Realms Stories of Realms they are a part of even when multiplayer access is disabled in the account's privacy settings
    
-   We recently shipped a couple of service changes behind the scenes (prior to this client update). You may have already experienced them since they have been live for a few weeks now:
    
    -   Persistent game settings: Changes using /gamerule do not persist when a world is unloaded/reloaded ([REALMS-10030](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/REALMS-10030))
        
        -   We now properly persist game settings updates made in-game via slash commands.
            
        -   Note that there is a bug in the Realms Edit World and in-game pause menu settings screens which causes settings that were adjusted via in-game slash commands to not display properly and also causes changes made in those screens to not save properly. If that happens to you, just run the in-game slash commands again.
            
        -   We are working on a resolution for the UI bug and expect to have it fixed soon.
            
    -   Server hosting region allocation: We are working behind the scenes to improve how Realms are assigned to data center regions. Currently we are only testing these improvements for a subset of players to make sure there are no negative side effects. So far, the change has dramatically reduced network latency, improving the connection of these players to their Realms. We will be sharing a lot more information about this soon when we roll the change out to all Realms. Keep your eyes open!
        

## Recipes

-   Added content error when parsing shaped recipes if none of the keys can be mapped to any of the pattern characters, this fixes a crash when opening the crafting screen with such malformed recipes ([MCPE-178520](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-178520))

## User Interface

-   Disabling Realms Stories badge notifications via the Stories Settings screen now hides badges in the Story Feed as well as the Play Screen
    
-   Touch Controls: The empty space in the center of the D-pad no longer acts as the forward button when flying or swimming ([MCPE-183944](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-183944))
    
-   Fixed Players needed to skip night slider on the Edit World screen to be able to go to 0%
    
-   Changed wording for lowest number required for player sleeping to skip the night.
    
-   In response to player feedback signaling confusion around the meaning of the potion bottle, we've updated the location, labeling and icon usage for Achievements across multiple screens.
    
-   For the achievement % counter, a new book asset replaced the potion bottle and supports multi-tier visual states to celebrate progress, including a delightful animation for 100% completion.
    
-   Consolidated the fancy graphics toggle and ray tracing toggle into a single Graphics Mode dropdown. Fancy and Ray Tracing mode are equivalent to having the previous Fancy and Ray Tracing toggles enabled, and the Simple mode is equivalent to having neither of the previous toggles enabled.
    
-   Touch controls: It is now possible to place blocks on top of containers when flying downwards, like on PC. ([MCPE-176407](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-176407))

-   The achievements disabled crossed bottle icon is now a blocked icon.
    
-   Fixed a bug where incorrect text would be shown on the bed screen ([MCPE-189823](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-189823))
    
-   Added support for input glyph replacement for signs, signed books, and NPC dialogs. For example, using input string ":\_input\_key.jump:" will be replaced with "JUMP" when using keyboard, or an emoji in case of using a gamepad.
    
-   Added full support and fixes for some input glyph replacement strings. This is to make them work across all the platforms (PC, Consoles, Mobile). These are the values fixed:
    
    -   :\_input\_key.forward:
    -   :\_input\_key.back:
    -   :\_input\_key.left:
    -   :\_input\_key.right:
    -   :\_input\_key.inventory:
    -   :\_input\_key.use:
    -   :\_input\_key.chat:
    -   :\_input\_key.attack:
    -   :\_input\_key.sprint:
-   The icons for these strings are updated in diverse areas of the game that support contextual glyphs, such as: signs, signed books, tags, chat, commands.
    
-   Also, as improvement, replacement of these values depends on the interaction/control mode when using touch as input mode. These modes are Joystick & tap to interact, D-Pad & tap to interact, and Joystick & aim crosshair.
    

### Play Screen

-   We've introduced a brand new Play Screen:
    -   Worlds tab - access your saved local and LAN worlds.
    -   Realms tab - easily jump into Realms you own or have joined.
    -   Servers tab - join multiplayer featured servers from our partners, and add or access your custom servers.
    -   Create from template - create from, and rate, your owned templates, discover Minecraft creator made content.
