## **Experimental Features**

## **Breeze**

-   The Breeze is a cunning, hostile mob that can spawn via Trial Spawner in some rooms within Trial Chambers
-   The Breeze moves primarily by leaping around a target, sometimes jumping quite long distances
-   An aggressive adversary, the Breeze shoots volatile wind energy in the form of wind charge projectiles at its target
-   Wind charges deal a small amount of damage when colliding directly with an entity
-   After colliding with an entity or a block, wind charge projectiles produce a wind burst, which knocks back entities in the area by several blocks
-   Wind bursts also have the effect of 'activating' certain blocks:
    -   Non-Iron Doors and Trapdoors are flipped
    -   Fence Gates are flipped
    -   Buttons are pressed
    -   Levers are flipped
    -   Bells are rung and swung
    -   Lit Candles (both standalone and on cake) are extinguished
-   Wind bursts do not have any effect on Iron Doors, Iron Trapdoors, or any block being held in its position by a Redstone signal

## **Trial Spawner**

-   Trial Spawner is a new variant of Monster Spawners that ejects rewards upon completion and can have variable levels of challenge in multiplayer
-   The challenge level will increase for each new player a Trial Spawner notices nearby
    -   Challenge level will not decrease until it is reset during a Trial Spawner's cooldown
-   Unlike normal spawners, a Trial Spawner will spawn a limited number of mobs proportional to its current challenge level
    -   It can only spawn a mob at positions that are within line of sight
    -   It can spawn a mob regardless of any light level requirement the mob has
    -   Spawned mobs are persistent
-   Once all mobs are defeated, the Trial Spawner will eject a set of rewards proportional to the current challenge level
    -   After the rewards have been ejected, the Trial Spawner goes into cooldown for 30 minutes during which it will no longer spawn mobs
-   Trial Spawners cannot be crafted nor obtained by players in Survival - instead, they can be found naturally placed throughout Trial Chambers
-   Trial Spawners are extremely slow to mine and resistant to explosions, and will not drop even with Silk Touch
-   When placed in Creative, Trial Spawners have no mob type set by default
    -   The mob type can be set by interacting with it while holding a Spawn Egg
-   Creative and Spectator players cannot be detected or noticed by Trial Spawners

## **Trial Chambers**

-   Trial Chambers are a new structure in the Overworld where players can explore and take on combat challenges during the mid-game
    -   Trial Chambers are made out of a variety of Copper and Tuff blocks and can be found in different sizes from large to small
    -   Trial Chambers are a relatively common find throughout the Deepslate layer of the underground
-   The layout of each Trial Chamber is procedurally generated, and can include traps, reward chests and a variety of combat spaces
    -   Supply chests can be found between different rooms, and give you blocks and items which help you navigate your trials
    -   Reward chests are guarded by challenges in each room, and can be a source of enchanted books and equipment
    -   The loot found in reward chests are still being iterated, and are absolutely not final
-   Each Trial Chamber will include Trial Spawners with a melee, small melee, or ranged category:
    -   Melee
        -   Zombie
        -   Husk
        -   Slime
    -   Small Melee
        -   Spider
        -   Cave Spider
        -   Baby Zombie
        -   Silverfish
    -   Ranged
        -   Skeleton
        -   Stray
    -   Each Trial Spawner category will only use one mob for the entire structure when generated, and these mobs are randomized for each Trial Chamber
        -   For example, one Trial Chamber might only spawn Zombies, Cave Spiders and Strays, while another might only spawn Slimes, Silverfish and Skeletons
        -   The exceptions to this are some Trial Spawners in unique rooms which always spawn Breezes

## **Trial Key**

-   An item that can only be obtained from Trial Spawners
-   Trial Keys do not currently have any functionality

## **Armadillo**

-   Added the Armadillo
-   The Armadillo is a neutral mob
-   Drops Armadillo Scutes periodically
-   Drops Armadillo Scutes when brushed
-   Spawns in Savannas
-   Favorite food is Spider Eyes
-   When an Armadillo detects a threat, it rolls up
    -   Threats are:
        -   Players who are sprinting
        -   Players on a mount or in a vehicle
        -   Undead mobs
    -   It does not roll up if it is fleeing, in water, in the air, or if being led
    -   When an Armadillo is rolled up it does not walk, cannot eat, and will not be tempted by food
    -   It continues to scan for threats, and if there are no threats detected for 3 seconds, it will unroll

## **Armadillo Scutes**

-   Can be used to craft Wolf Armor
-   Dropped by Armadillos
-   Dispensers can be used to brush Armadillo Scutes off Armadillos

## **Wolf Armor**

-   Using Wolf Armor on an adult tamed Wolf will equip the armor on the Wolf
    -   Only a Wolf's owner can put Wolf Armor on their tamed Wolf, and with this in mind, Dispensers cannot put Wolf Armor on Wolves
-   Using Shears on a Wolf that is wearing armor will make it drop the armor
    -   Only a Wolf's owner can shear a Wolf Armor from it, and with this in mind, Dispensers cannot remove Wolf Armor from Wolves
-   Wolf Armor gives the same protection as Diamond Horse Armor
-   If a Wolf dies while wearing armor, it will drop the armor
