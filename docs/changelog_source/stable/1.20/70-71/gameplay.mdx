## **Vanilla Parity:**

## **Mobs**

-   Wolves can now withstand the same amount of damage as in Java Edition ([MCPE-177613](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-177613))
    -   Rather than halving all damage dealt to tamed Wolves by entities other than Players or Arrows, as currently done in Java Edition, the maximum health of tamed Wolves has been increased from 20 to 40
    -   Pre-existing tamed Wolves will need to be fed to reach the new maximum health
    -   To ensure the healing rate remains consistent, the health restored by feeding Wolves has been doubled
    -   Java Edition will be adjusted to match the new Bedrock Edition implementation  
          
        

## **Experimental Features:**

## **Wind Charge**

-   Become the Breeze! Using a Wind Charge will fire off a Wind Charge projectile similar to the Breeze's
-   A Wind Charge fired by a player will grant 10% more knockback than a Breeze's
-   Just like the projectile fired by the Breeze, Wind Charges fired by the player also deal damage if they hit an entity directly
-   The Breeze drops between 4-6 Wind Charges when killed
-   Wind Charges have a max stack size of 64
-   There is half a second cooldown after each use
-   Wind Charges can be fired from a dispenser
-   Players that launch themselves with a Wind Charge only accumulate fall damage below the y-level of where they collided with the wind burst

## **Bogged**

-   A new variant of Skeletons that shoot poisonous arrows
    -   They're faster to take down with 16 health instead of 20 health
    -   They attack at a slower interval of 3.5 seconds instead of 2 seconds
-   Has a chance to drop Arrows of Poison when killed by players
-   These mossy and mushroom covered Skeletons spawn naturally in Swamps and Mangrove Swamps
    -   Can also be found spawning from Trial Spawners in some Trial Chambers

## **Vault**

-   A block that holds locked treasure and loot - find the right key to eject its rewards
    -   Found throughout Trial Chambers, containing the structures' most valuable loot
    -   Vaults in Trial Chambers require a Trial Key to be unlocked
-   Can be unlocked by an unlimited amount of players
    -   After a player has unlocked a Vault, they cannot unlock that Vault again
    -   If a player has not unlocked that Vault before, an orange stream of particles will flow from the player to the Vault when nearby
-   Has a keyhole that will be open or closed depending on the players nearby
    -   If any nearby player has not unlocked that Vault, the keyhole will be open
    -   If all nearby players have unlocked that Vault, the keyhole will be closed
-   Within its cage, it will cycle through and display items which are possible to eject from its loot table
-   The rewards it ejects are randomized from its loot table each time it is unlocked
-   Vaults currently reuse the same loot table that reward chests previously used in the Trial Chambers
    -   This loot table is temporary and will be completely revised as development continues
-   Cannot be crafted or obtained in Survival mode, and does not drop anything when mined
-   Explosion-resistant and cannot be moved

## **Wolf**

-   The collars of tamed Wolves have been increased in size, making them visible not only from the front but also from other angles
