## **Updated Add-On Template Packs**

-   Updated Add-On templates for 1.17.10 are available for download with new resources, behaviors, and documentation
    -   Resource Pack Template: [aka.ms/resourcepacktemplate](https://aka.ms/resourcepacktemplate)
    -   Behavior Pack Template (Includes documentation): [aka.ms/behaviorpacktemplate](https://aka.ms/behaviorpacktemplate)

## **Stability and Performance**

-   Added better error handling for JSON parsing. Also added several new content errors for item parsing as well as for loot tables

## **General**

-   Players are given a content error when custom recipes are invalid
-   Renamed "minecraft:scaffolding\_climber" to "minecraft:block\_climber". It now processes climbing both Scaffolding and Powder Snow

## **Gameplay**

-   Loot chests with Seed=0 now correctly randomize if placed on the same coordinates. Note that Pick Blocking a Vanilla loot chest before opening it will now result in identical loot in each copy unless the seed is set to 0 in the NBT

## **Dedicated Server**

-   Added back missing symbols for Bedrock Dedicated Server on Linux ([BDS-13482](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/BDS-13482))

## **NPC Dialogue**

-   Content creators can now create multi-page dialogues with branching narrative for NPCs using the '/dialogue' command and dialogue JSON files

## **Data-Driven Mobs**

-   The Ender Dragon rendering and animations are now fully data-driven
-   The Ender Crystal rendering and animations are now fully data-driven
-   The Horse rendering and animations are now fully data-driven
-   This work supports all Horse variants (Horse, Mule, Donkey, Zombie Horse, Skeleton Horse) and all Horse versions including:
    -   v1 (engine version 1.2.5 and earlier)
    -   v2 (engine version 1.2.6 to 1.17.0)
    -   v3 (engine version 1.17.10 and onward). This will be a cleaner version of the v2 model, with less confusing bone naming

## **Data-Driven Items**

-   Updated documentation for 'DisplayNameItemComponent'

## **Data-Driven Blocks**

-   Updated documentation for 'BlockUnwalkableComponent'

## **Actors**

-   Incoming client-sync properties for newly seen types will properly register with client-side Actor Property Manager groups

## **MoLang**

-   "query.wing\_flap\_position" now works with the Ender Dragon
-   Added "query.show\_bottom" - a query for determining whether or not the entity's bottom is rendered
-   Added "query.death\_time" - a query for determining the elapsed ticks since a mob started dying
-   Added "math.min\_angle" - a math expression for minimizing the angle magnitude (in degrees) into the range \[-180, 180\]
-   Fixed experimental 'query.target' to work on client-side queries

## **Chunk Loading**

-   Limits writing of chunks unless necessary. Chunks upgraded from older formats will not automatically save when loaded, but when modified (Through blocks or actors, for example) they will be marked for saving

## **GameTest Framework (Experimental)**
