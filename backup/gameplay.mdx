<GrayH4Strong>Pottery Shards and Decorated Pots</GrayH4Strong>

#### **陶片和饰纹陶罐**

- <GrayText>Pottery Shards have pictures on them. They cannot be crafted and must be found in the world. Hint: you will need a Brush! By crafting four of these together you can create a Decorated Pot with a picture on each side.</GrayText>
- 陶片上有图案。他们不能被合成，必须从世界中获取。提示：你会需要一把刷子的！通过将四个陶片放在一起你可以合成出一个每面都有一个图案的饰纹陶罐。
- You can also use Brick items instead of Pottery Shards in the crafting recipe. The sides that were made from Brick items will not have pictures.
- Smash a Decorated Pot with any block-breaking tool to break it apart and get the Pottery Shards back! Or hit it with your fist to pick up the pot without breaking it.

#### **Suspicious Sand**

- Desert Temples and Desert Wells now contain Suspicious Sand. This fragile block is hard to spot and easy to destroy, so be careful!
- If you manage to find the Suspicious Sand and brush it with your Brush, you will extract objects that were buried long ago.

#### **Work in Progress**

- We're giving you an early look at these Archaeology features. We want to spend more time developing them. Please let us know where you think we can improve or expand!
