have mobs spawn at the center of a block instead of at the corner of a block. This fixes many issues where mobs could not spawn on slopes, in narrow passageways and in other situations where they were expected to. For technical players, this bug fix will mean that some player-made mob farms no longer fully work. We appreciate the time the community puts into building clever farms and we try to avoid breaking farms when we can.
