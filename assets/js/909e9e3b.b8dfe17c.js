mobs spawn at the center of a block instead of at the corner of a block. This fixes many issues where mobs could not spawn on slopes, in narrow passageways and in other situations where they were expected to. For technical players, this bug fix will mean that some player-made mob farms no longer fully work. We appreciate the time the community puts into building clever farms and we try to avoid breaking farms when we can. In this case, we felt that this change was necessary because it improves the way spawning works in many biomes."]}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"realms",children:(0,i.jsx)(n.strong,{children:"Realms"})}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(n.ul,{children:["\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.li,{children:"Fixed crashes that could occur when creating worlds on new Realms and backing out at the Online Safety dialog box"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.li,{children:"Updated the 'Are you sure you want to opt out?'
