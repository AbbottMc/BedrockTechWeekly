Yodelay hee hoooooo! Ahem, excuse me! Ever since I set up shop on top of this stony peak, I’ve been communicating exclusively through yodels. I’ll switch back to words for this Bedrock Beta update, that brings you updates from these heights all the way down to dripstone and lush caves. We hope you enjoy this beta, and please let us know what you think by sending your feedback to [aka.ms/CavesCliffsFeedback](http://aka.ms/CavesCliffsFeedback) and any bugs you catch at [bugs.mojang.com](http://bugs.mojang.com/).

We would also love to hear your feedback on the game's performance! After you've enabled the Caves & Cliffs Experimental Features, let us know if you experienced any lag in your worlds in this short survey: [aka.ms/MCPerfPoll](https://aka.ms/MCPerfPoll)
