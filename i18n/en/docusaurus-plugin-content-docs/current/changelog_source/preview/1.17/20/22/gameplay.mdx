We have another Bedrock Beta update today, and we've fixed a bunch of bugs! Also, we've made a fairly significant change to the way hostile mobs spawn - to test this out you'll need to enable the [Caves and Cliffs Experimental Features](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360075718432). We're hoping this change will make your cave spelunking trips slightly safer, but you'll still need to avoid falling in lava with a hotbar full of diamonds. Not that that ever happens, right? 

Please send us your feedback in the threads at [https://aka.ms/CavesCliffsFeedback](https://aka.ms/CavesCliffsFeedback), and search and report any new bugs you may encounter at [https://bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/).  

# **Experimental Features** 

-   Monsters will only spawn in complete darkness  
    -   This change is being made to balance the player's ability to light up the new larger caves and make them safe from monster spawning 
    -   Note that this change only affects block-light and not sky-light 
    -   Please send us your feedback on this change at [aka.ms/CCMobSpawningFeedback](https://aka.ms/CCMobSpawningFeedback)!
