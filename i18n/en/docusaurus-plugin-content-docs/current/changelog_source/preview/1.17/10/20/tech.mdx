-   The Ender Dragon rendering and animations are now fully data-driven
-   The Ender Crystal rendering and animations are now fully data-driven

## **Graphics**

-   Graphics hardware that supports a maximum D3D11 feature level of 9\_3 or below are no longer supported

## **Stability and Performance**

-   Added better error handling for json parsing. Also added several new content errors for item parsing as well as for loot tables

## **Actors**

-   Incoming client-sync properties for newly seen types will properly register with client-side Actor Property Manager groups

-   Added "math.min\_angle" - a math expression for minimizing the angle magnitude (in degrees) into the range \[-180, 180)
