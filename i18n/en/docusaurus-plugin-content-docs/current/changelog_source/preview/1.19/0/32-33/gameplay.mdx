# **Features and Bug Fixes**

## **Allay**

-   Allay, for now, does not teleport with its owner to Nether. This is a temporary change until we can fix an issue where Allays would sometimes get teleported inside blocks and suffocate when changing dimension ([MCPE-155678](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-155678))

## **Blocks**

-   Non-generated Sculk Shriekers now have a cooldown between activations, just like their generated counterparts ([MCPE-153944](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-153944))
-   Sculk Shriekers and Sculk Sensors do not drop XP anymore when mined with Silk Touch ([MCPE-153359](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-153359), [MCPE-153965](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-153965))
-   Increased the time required to destroy Reinforced Deepslate and made it independent by the used tool, to better match Java Edition ([MCPE-154097](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-154097))
-   Sculk cannot spread through Fire and Soul Fire anymore

## **Mangrove Swamp**

-   Mangrove trees now grow properly at negative Y coordinates ([MCPE-154983](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-154983))

## **Movement**

-   Actors using movement prediction will once again teleport smoothly

## **Stability and Performance**

-   Improved game performance on certain Android devices ([MCPE-142934](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-142934))
