Do you know what a writer’s worst fear is? No, not rejection – typos! Luckily this week’s experimental features for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition include the ability to edit your signs, write on both sides, and even lock your text by applying wax! Once you’ve rewritten all your signs, you can point them towards the new suspicious gravel block being added in this week’s changelog, or even fill them with crafting instructions for the new sculk sensor. The choice is yours! Discover the new sign customization along with suspicious gravel and other new features that will join Minecraft in the Trails & Tales Update later this year. Don’t forget to send us all your feedback and ideas at [aka.ms/MC120Feedback](http://aka.ms/MC120Feedback) and report any bugs to [bugs.mojang.com](http://bugs.mojang.com/)

# **Experimental Features**

## **Calibrated Sculk Sensors**

-   A new variant of Sculk Sensors which allows you to filter vibrations based on their frequency level. They are not found naturally and can only be crafted
-   They can be crafted with 1 Sculk Sensor and 3 Amethyst Shards in the Crafting Table
-   One side of the Calibrated Sculk Sensor can receive a Redstone signal as input
    -   The strength of that Redstone signal is the only vibration frequency the Sculk Sensor will listen to
-   Leave us your feedback for this feature here!

## **Vibration Resonance**

-   Blocks of Amethyst have a new behavior when placed adjacent to Sculk Sensors
    -   If that Sculk Sensor receives a vibration, the Block of Amethyst will re-emit its frequency as a separate vibration at its location
    -   This behaviour is called Vibration Resonance, and allows players to move vibration frequencies across long distances without having to recreate the vibration naturally

## **Sign Improvements**

-   Signs have improved customization options
-   Sign text can now be edited after being placed in the world
    -   This can be done by interacting with the Sign
-   Both sides of the Sign can now have separate text and colors, allowing for further customization options
    -   By default, a Sign will prompt you to input the front side's text when placed
    -   To apply text to the back-side, you must walk to the other side and interact with that face to edit it
-   Signs can now also be waxed with Honeycomb, preventing any further edits to its text
-   Send us your feedback on these improvements here!
