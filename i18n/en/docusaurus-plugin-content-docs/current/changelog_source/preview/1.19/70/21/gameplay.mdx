Here's a list of what is new in this week's Minecraft Preview and Beta! Just a note about armor trims: These are available to test out in the [Java Edition snapshot](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-23w04a), but they are not _quite_ ready for the Bedrock Edition Beta and Preview just yet.
