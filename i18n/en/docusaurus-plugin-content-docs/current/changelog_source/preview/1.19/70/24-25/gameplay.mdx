Greetings, crafty companions! Are you ready to get your game on? We know you are, and that's why we're excited to bring you the latest scoop on our latest gameplay beta update. 

We highly value your feedback, so please keep sending us your thoughts on the 1.20 features! Often we release new features to Java snapshots and Bedrock betas and previews the same week in, but this is not always the best option since different features can be more or less time consuming to build in Java compared to Bedrock and we do need to get feedback from you our players early so we find both cool ideas and nasty bugs. Right now we are working on new tech to bring the armor trims to Bedrock and we are trimming the last things for the new cherry blossom biome, you will be able to try both features out soon. So, hang tight, my fellow miners and crafters. The fun is just beginning, and we can't wait to see what you'll create. Stay tuned for more updates, and keep on digging!

As always, you can send us all your feedback and ideas at [aka.ms/MC120Feedback](https://aka.ms/MC120Feedback) and report any bugs to [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com).
