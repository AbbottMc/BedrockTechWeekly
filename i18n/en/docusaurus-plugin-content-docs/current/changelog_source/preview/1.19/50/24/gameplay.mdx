# **Features and Bug Fixes**

## **Mobs**

-   Updated Vex model and texture
    -   The Vex retains a slightly larger hitbox to make it easier to fight

## **Gameplay**

-   Fixed a bug where players could get moved to the other side of a wall when close to a retracting Piston
-   Fixed Beehives not gaining honey when a Bee with nectar exits ([MCPE-163938](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-163938))

## **Touch Controls**

-   Made keyboard input consistent with other control modes when the player is flying and using touch controls. Now, double pressing the "Space" key can correctly disable flying in touch control mode
-   Fixed an issue which prevented items from being discarded in the extended Creative Mode inventory by dropping them on another item ([MCPE-162124](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-162124))

## **Commands**

-   Running ‘/execute align xyz entity’now produces a command error instead of crashing ([MCPE-162733](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-162733))
