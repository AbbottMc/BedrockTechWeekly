# **Features and Bug Fixes**

## **Vanilla Parity**

### **Spectator Mode (Experimental)**

-   Parrots sitting on a player's shoulder now hop off when entering Spectator Mode
-   Animals and mobs with _follow\_owner_ behaviour no longer follow Spectators
-   Animals and mobs with _find\_mount_ behaviour no longer try to mount Spectators
-   Spectator Mode players won't have cold feet and now the Frost Walker enchant does not affect water

### **General**

-   Fixed an issue where Light Blocks would be removed when placing an Armor stand over them ([MCPE-151856](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-151856))

## **Commands**

-   Changed some structure's names in the /locate command to have underscores, like in Java Edition (e.g. ancientcity -\> ancient\_city); the old names will still work but will not show up in the autocomplete

    -   Control + Alt + C is the default for copying current coordinates
    -   Control + Alt + X is the default for copying coordinates of selected block
    -   Needs the "Enable Copy Coordinate UI" enabled in Creator settings
-   Pressing the Ctrl and Alt keys together will no longer make the Alt key get stuck down
