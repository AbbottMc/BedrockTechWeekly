# **Features and Bug Fixes**

## **Blocks**

-   Campfires can once again be stacked correctly ([MCPE-159398](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-159398))

## **Graphical**

-   **Please note:** Due to an unexpected crashing issue we have had to temporarily revert the fix for [MCPE-105487](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-105487), which can cause the textures to turn pink after playing for long periods of time on a server
    -   This means that this bug may continue to occur until we have a solution. Thank you for your patience while we continue to work on this important issue – we hope to have it finally fixed as soon as possible!
-   Fixed an issue with RTX on Windows where point lights were unintentionally accumulated for emissive blocks ([MCPE-159485](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-159485), [MCPE-159488](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-159488))

## **Items**

-   Fixed a bug where Pistons sometimes did not drop the Piston item when broken by the arm ([MCPE-158314](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-158314))
-   Fixed a bug where Bows could fail to shoot an Arrow the first time they were used, this also affected Crossbows and with throwing Tridents ([MCPE-159467](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-159467))
