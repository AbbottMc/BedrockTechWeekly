## **Account Suspensions**

-   Fixed a bug where suspended accounts could not play local worlds or navigate the menus on Xbox platforms

## **Actor Properties**

-   Added new Molang _had\_component\_group_ to allow calculating appropriate default values from previously saved entity data
-   Renamed _'actor\_property'_ and _'has\_actor\_property'_ Molang queries to _'property'_ and _'has\_property'_. Also renamed _'set\_actor\_property'_ to _'set\_property'_
-   Update _'set\_property'_ to only allow changing properties on the local actor rather than some other target
