## **AI Goals**

-   Exposed new data parameter "calculate\_new\_path\_radius" for the Go Home Goal. This is for specifying a distance in blocks that the mob is considered close enough to the end of the current path. A new path will then be calculated to continue toward home

## **Animation**

-   Fixed a bug where timeline events at 0.0 would sometimes not run in looping animations

## **Mobs**

# **Technical Experimental Features**

-   Due to engine limitations, "minecraft:geometry" data used for blocks with the Holiday Creator Features experimental toggle are now restricted to only allow geometry in the \[0,0,0\] to \[15,15,15\] space. Any blocks loaded from behavior packs that exceed this limit will render as the info\_update block and show a content error in the log.
