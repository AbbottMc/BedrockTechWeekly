Welcome to a very special Bedrock Beta! I didn’t want to get my hops up and to be honest I was a tad worried that it was just a fever dream. But what if I toad you that this week we’re releasing a new mob into the Overworld’s ecosystem. I don’t mean to be amphibious, er… I mean ambiguous. Sorry, I am practically jumping out of my skin because we have a very exciting surprise for you.

This week’s Bedrock Beta introduces…

Drumroll…

Wait for it…

Logs to the game!

Isn’t that exciting? Finally! Wait. What? We already have logs in the game? But why is everyone at the studio so excited? Oooooh, because we’ve added _frogs_ to the Beta! I hope you enjoy them more than you did these puns, to try out these new features all you have to do is enable The Wild Update Experimental Toggle! Please leave us any specific feedback or suggestions in the thread at [aka.ms/MCFrogFeedback](https://aka.ms/MCFrogFeedback), and as always please search and report any bugs you may find at [bugs.mojang.com](http://bugs.mojang.com/).

# **Known Issues**

-   The game may crash when opening Settings on some Windows devices
    -   Workaround: We have verified on multiple devices that enabling Full Language Packages, including the text-to-speech component, can resolve the crash
    -   **Steps on how to Install the Full Language Package**
        
        1.  Launch Windows device
        2.  Sign in
        3.  Open Start Menu \> Settings
        4.  Select “Time & Language”
        5.  Select “Language”
        6.  Select “Add a language”
        7.  Select your language of choice to install
        8.  Ensure that the “Text-to-speech” component is selected
        9.  Select “Install”
    -   Please be sure to also run Windows Update to install the latest updates for your Windows 10/11 device, as this has helped with resolving the crash
