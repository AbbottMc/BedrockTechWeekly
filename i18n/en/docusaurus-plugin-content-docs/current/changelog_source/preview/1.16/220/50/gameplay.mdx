-   You will not have access to Realms and will not be able to join non-beta players while you're previewing the beta
-   Any worlds played while in the beta cannot be opened in previous versions of the game so please make copies of worlds to prevent losing them

## **New Experimental Features:**

In this week's beta we have some exciting new Caves and Cliffs features that are accessible by enabling the "Experimental Features" toggle on your worlds! (You can find out more about using the toggles at [aka.ms/MCExperimentalToggle](https://aka.ms/MCExperimentalToggle).)

## **Please note:** The blending between the old generation and the new generation in this beta is not finalized yet. We want to make sure we respect players' old worlds being upgraded to the new world generation and are working hard to improve the biome blending for the full Caves and Cliffs release!

You can leave us your feedback for these features in the threads at [aka.ms/CavesCliffsFeedback](https://aka.ms/CavesCliffsFeedback), and search and reports any new bugs you may encounter at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/).
