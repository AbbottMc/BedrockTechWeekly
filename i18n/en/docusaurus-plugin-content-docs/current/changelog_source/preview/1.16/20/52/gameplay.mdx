## Fixes 

-   Pressure plates have been fixed to have no collision again [MCPE-80276](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-80276) 
-   Local split-screen players can once again see the Ender Dragon and Ender Crystal [MCPE-67596](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-67596) 
-   Fixed a crash that occurred on PlayStation 4 due to other players using custom skins 
-   The Angry system now checks if the mob with the angry component can attack before broadcasting anger to others, rather than after broadcasting anger to others. This avoids a never-ending loop when multiple mobs triggered each other’s anger indefinitely on peaceful

-   Behavior animation components will no longer try to reload after a suspend resume and a mob/player rides something

-   Making command selectors use the current position of an actor rather than the previous position of an actor
-   Fixed an issue that could prevent the Marketplace loading correctly
-   Meeting requirements for some achievements offline will now unlock it after reconnecting
-   Fixed an issue that could cause Command Blocks to stop working unexpectedly
-   The bounding box of the player used for spawning is now the correct size, so we don't think a player is in a dangerous spot when they are actually safe
-   Parity: Fixed the issue with chests with loot tables not generating loot until opened or destroyed 
-   Made using the '/fill' command more efficient, improving performance 
-   Fixed a crash that could occur when pressing the Manage Account button in Profile settings
