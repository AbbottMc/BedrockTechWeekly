## **Strider**

## **Admire Item Component**

-   Mobs can now admire items they pick up or receive during an interaction. For a mob to admire an item they need to have both the admire\_item goal and the admire\_item component, and the relevant configuration need to be done in the interact component and/or the shareables component

## **Component Variables**

-   sound\_interval - The range of time in seconds to randomly wait before playing the sound again

## **Avoid Mob Type Goal**

Several new variables have been introduced to the avoid\_mob\_type goal

## **Goal Variables**

-   avoid\_mob\_sound - The sound event to play when the mob is angry
-   sound\_interval - The range of time in seconds to randomly wait before playing the sound again

## **Barter Component**

Mobs can now barter when they pick up items, or when they receive an item during an interaction. For a mob to barter they need to have both the barter goal and the barter component, and the relevant configuration need to be done in the interact component and/or the shareables component

## **Component Variables**

-   barter\_table - A path to a loot table, which is used to determine what items the mob gives out during barter
-   cooldown\_after\_being\_attacked - Specifies for how long the goal will be unavailable after the mob is attacked, the default value is 0

## **Barter Goal**

-   Mobs can now barter when they pick up items, or when they receive an item during an interaction. For a mob to barter they need to have both the barter goal and the barter component, and the relevant configuration need to be done in the interact component and/or the shareables component

## **Goal Variables**

-   priority - Specifies how the mob should prioritize this goal

## **Celebrate Hunt Component**

-   Specifies that the mob should have the hunt celebration behavior

## **Component Variables**

-   broadcast - If true, celebration will be broadcasted to other entities in the radius. Default value is true

## **Interact Component**

## **Component Variables**

-   barter - If true the mob will try to activate the barter goal after the interaction, default value is false
-   admire - If true the mob will try to activate the admire goal after the interaction, default value is false

## **MoveToLavaGoal**

-   Added the MoveToLava goal, similar to MoveToWater goal. Mob tries to find and move to lava

## **Navigation component**

-   Navigationcomponent now has can\_path\_over\_lava and can\_walk\_in\_lava parameters, allowing mobs (like the strider) to traverse lava

## **PanicGoal**

-   Changed the priority from the damage type to the "ignore\_mob\_damage" flag (if that flag is set and a mob attacks the mob with the Panic Goal, they will not panic even if the damage type matches one in their "damage\_sources" list)
-   Changed damage types from being hard-coded to being data-driven using the existing "Entity Damage Sources"
-   Changed the default from "fire, fire\_tick, magma" (old hardcoded behavior) to "all"  
    Pre-1.16 mobs will default to "fire, fire\_tick, magma"

## **Pickup Items Goal**

## **The PickupItemsGoal only considers items that the mob can reach**

-   When determining whether the goal can be used we now check whether the mob can reach an item it’s interested in, before committing to it as the target of the goal. This is to avoid mobs getting stuck in this goal after deciding to pick up an item they cannot reach

## **PickupBasedOnChance variable**

-   This new variable was added to be used for monsters that can pickup items sometimes but also preserve mobs that used this goal in the past like Villagers. If this variable is true, the mob will have a calculation done (based on things like time played by the player, game difficulty, and moon brightness) to determine if this is a mob that is allowed to pickup items. That value is only calculated on the mob’s first spawn, which means it is forever saved on that mob and doesn’t change. If the variable is false (which it is by default), the mob will always be able to pickup items using the goal

## **CanPickupAnyItem variable**

-   The PickupItemsGoal is dependent on the ShareableComponent and the items that are added to its items list. This new variable overrides that list and tells the component that this mob can pickup any item even if it isn’t in the list. Items picked up because of this variable still honor the priority set to items in the list of items however. This means that any items with a set priority in the list will still be picked up over any item that may be picked up because of this variable. By default it is set to false

## **CooldownAfterBeingAttacked variable**

-   The variable cooldown\_after\_being\_attacked has been added to the goal, specifying for how many seconds after being attacked the goal should be unavailable. The default value is 0

## **CanPickupToHandOrEquipment variable**

-   Specifying if the mob can equip items that it picks up or put items in its hand, or if it belongs in the inventory

## **Shareable Component**

## **Component Variables**

-   item/barter - If true the mob will try to activate the barter goal after picking up the item, default value is false
-   item/admire - If true the mob will try to activate the admire goal after picking up the item, default value is false
-   item/consume\_item - Specifies if an item should be consumed, for instance Piglins consume (eat) porkchop. Default value is false
-   item/stored\_in\_inventory - Specifies if the item is desired to be picked up and stored in the mobs inventory. Default value is false

## **Tweaked a number of in-game sounds**

-   A large amount of sounds have had their volume and pitch slightly changed in order to get close to Java parity when it comes to sound, and come closer how these sounds where intended to sound
-   This change has gone into all slices - because previous behavior has been wrong and should not be used by content creators. Creator that relied on the previous volume and pitch need to override that in their content from now on

## **Splash Text**

-   The Splash Text loading code has been augmented to allow splash text JSON files to be additive, rather than replacing them completely, and to allow some conditional statements to disable splash text entries. Use a field called "canMerge" that sits next to the "splashes" field, it is a bool that defaults to 'false'. Also, another sibling of "splashes" is "conditional", which is an array of objects. Those objects contain a "requires" field and a "splashes" field. The "splashes" field is an array of strings like the original "splashes" field, and the "requires" field contains three fields - "platforms", "treatments", and "stores", each of which is an array of strings that is compared with the relevant data
