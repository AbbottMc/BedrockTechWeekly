-   Updated Actor Properties. Two fields that were invalid and appeared in some vanilla content will now give a content error. The field "value" on "minecraft:can\_fly" and the property "minecraft:foot\_size" should simply be removed from any entity files 
-   Make boat use the Buoyancy Component. Added two new components, the inside\_block\_notifiercomponent, which fires specified events when the actor enters or exits specified blocks, and the out\_of\_control component, which sets a corresponding actor flag, in order to make this possible 
-   Added error checks to parsing of minecraft shareables items. Displays content log if item name is invalid or the array is empty 
-   Attempting to load a custom material that is not defined no longer causes a crash. A proper content error is now thrown 
-   Exposed new data parameters to control the behavior of Drop Item For Goal. This includes: "seconds\_before\_pickup", "cooldown", "minimum\_teleport\_distance", "max\_head\_look\_at\_height", "teleport\_offset", and "entity\_types". Check out the new Actor component documentation! 
-   Exposed new data parameters to control the behavior of Harvest Farm Block Goal, including "max\_seconds\_before\_search", "search\_cooldown\_max\_seconds", and "seconds\_until\_new\_task". Check out the new Actor component documentation! 

## **Aseprite**

-   The UI now supports using aseprite JSON files for animations, which allows more advanced animations than simple flip books

## **Commands**

-   Added a new /structure command that allows to save and load structures without having to use structure blocks 
-   Added /playanimation command which allows you to run a one-off animation. It assumes all variables have been setup correctly for the animation to run
-   Added /ride command which allows you to make entities ride other entities, stop entities from riding, make rides evict their riders, or summon rides or riders

## **Format Version Checks**

-   Updated the format\_versionfield in geometry, particles, and animation files to behave as entity behavior files do. That is, you no longer need to specify a specific version for it to be accepted, instead you can just specify the version of the release you are targeting
