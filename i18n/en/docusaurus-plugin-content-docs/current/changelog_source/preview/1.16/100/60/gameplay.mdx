## **Performance and Stability** 

-   Fixed a crash on that could occur when Player 1 in a split-screen session disconnects their controller ([MCPE-99565)](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-99565)

## **Gameplay** 

-   When the '/clone' command replaces a double chest with another double chest, it now sets their pairing correctly upon load. This way it doesn't cause errors before it ticks to match up the pair

## **G****raphical** 

-   Touchscreen input "Chat and Commands" UI element now has a darker border  
-   "Tip" messages no longer appear off screen  
-   Added the ability to animate the placement of a structure with the '/structure' command   
-   Changed vignette layer from 4 to 5 to prevent drawing vignette in between hotbar items

## **Technical Changes** 

-   Fixed updating of bounding box to happen after proper scale has been set
