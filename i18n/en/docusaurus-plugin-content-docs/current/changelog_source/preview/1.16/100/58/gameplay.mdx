**PLEASE READ before participating in the Minecraft Beta:**

-   The beta is available only on Xbox One, Windows 10, and Android (Google Play). To join or leave the beta, see [aka.ms/JoinMCBeta](https://aka.ms/JoinMCBeta) for detailed instructions

## **Performance and Stability**

-   Fixed several crashes that could occur during gameplay
-   Fixed a crash that occurred when rendering
-   Fixed a crash that could occur when a stunned entity loaded into the world
-   Fixed a crash that could occur in certain Marketplace layouts, and ensured the carousel is always populated correctly

## **Gameplay**

-   Fixed an issue with tall plants (bamboo, sugar cane, and cactus) breaking instantly ([MCPE-98111](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-98111))
-   Fixed a bug that prevented lava buckets from being used as fuel ([MCPE-100405](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-100405))

## **General**

-   Fixed an issue where animations in the achievement screen could be played backwards
-   Fixed missing translation loading screen tip ([MCPE-100308](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-100308))

## **Technical Changes**

-   Removed legacy fall damage packet from client
-   Made some small changes around how we calculate the spawn position of dropped items from a player that dies from falling
-   Added support for the music command, allowing creators to play and control custom music
-   Changed LegacyCubemap from opaque to transparent ([MCPE-94275](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-94275))
-   Fog Definition identifier cannot use the "minecraft" namespace unless it's from a vanilla resource pack
-   Blocks that have ticking components will now clear their pending ticks from the ticking queue upon removal
    -   Added the on\_player\_destroyed trigger component

## **DataDrivenBlocks**

-   Middle click on non-default permutations of data driven blocks no longer throws an assert. Middle click now adds the default permutation of the block to your inventory
-   Added a fix for blocks computing ambient occlusion to behave more like vanilla by only contributing ambient occlusion if it's an opaque unit cube
-   Made data driven blocks with disabled collision pathable 

## **Documentation**

-   Added documentation for block event responses and re-organized block documentation
