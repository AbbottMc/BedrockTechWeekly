## **Known Issues:**

-   Entities are not rendered for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th players while playing in splitscreen on Xbox consoles  
      
    

## **Vanilla Parity:**

-   Players now experience ambient sounds in The Nether ([MCPE-74756](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-74756))
    -   We're aware of mobile players not hearing the sounds even after updating the Minecraft Music Pack. The team is working on a fix for this  
          
        

## **Fixes:**

## **General**

-   Players are once again able to join servers when the server has view-distance set to 4 or less ([BDS-8855](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/BDS-8855))
-   Animations for custom mobs based on vanilla actor types for their "runtime\_identifier" (such as Pandas and Polar Bears) will now work properly ([MCPE-95898](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-95898))
-   Brought back capability to rejoin a server after it has been suspended and resumed
