There’s so much packed into this week’s preview and beta release that I need a code to remember it all. What about “wolf armor-dillos”? Because in this week’s preview and beta, you’ll not only find updated wolf armor (it’s stronger! and repairable! and awesome!) you’ll be able to dye it any color you want. If that wasn’t enough, the armadillo has been de-experimentified (definitely a word) and we’ve taken the first steps towards working on something exciting (more on that below). Was that everything? Maybe I should’ve made a list, instead of a code. Anyway! As always, we want to hear your thoughts and feedback, so please let us know what you think [here](https://feedback.minecraft.net/), and report any bugs you may encounter at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/).  
  

## **Known Issue:** Players are unable to connect to Preview Realms on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in this version.  
  

# Experimental Features

## Vault

-   Vault hit sound pitch corrected to match Java Edition
-   Updated Vault visuals

## Trial Chambers

-   Trial Chambers will now be placed in the same location and configuration as Java Edition

## Coming Soon: Hardcore Mode

We're excited to say we're working on Hardcore mode for Bedrock Edition, and we hope it'll be ready for testing sometime in the Spring. Hardcore mode is a subcategory of Survival, where you only get one life, and no chance to respawn. Not only that, in Hardcore mode the difficulty is locked to the highest setting!

With such high stakes, we want to ensure we get Hardcore mode right before releasing it into the retail version of Bedrock Edition, so once it goes into testing it’ll stay in Preview until we’re confident the experience is smooth for both players and creators. You’ll be able to help us test Hardcore mode by submitting bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/) and giving us your feedback on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/minecraft) or at [feedback.minecraft.net](http://feedback.minecraft.net/)!

We're also happy to announce, when we are ready, Hardcore mode will be available in Realms for both Java and Bedrock.  
  

# Features and Bug Fixes

## Wolf Armor

Since the initial release of the Wolf Armor, we have been working on improving it to increase its protection, usability and add customization. For protection there is a new approach to armor, which considers the player’s need to quickly see the state of the armor without using UI elements, and the ability to act quickly to help their pet Wolf if needed.

-   Wolf Armor has been de-experimentified and is now available during normal gameplay
-   Wolf Armor can now be dyed
-   Wolf Armor now acts as a shield, absorbing most damage directed to the Wolf:
    -   The Wolf Armor now has 64 durability
    -   More cracks appear on the Wolf Armor as it takes more damage
    -   If the Wolf Armor is dealt damage beyond 0 durability, it will break
    -   But no worries, the Wolf Armor can now be repaired by using Armadillo Scutes on a sitting Wolf
-   **Known Issue:**
    -   Wolves wearing Wolf Armor don’t trigger post-damage invulnerability, resulting in the Wolf Armor being rapidly destroyed by continuous sources of damage, such as lava, Slimes, and Magma Cubes

## Wolves

-   The collars of tamed Wolves are now properly shaded ([MCPE-178351](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-178351))
-   Wolves’ tails are now correctly positioned when sitting ([MCPE-31121](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-31121))

## Armadillo

-   The Armadillo has been de-experimentified and is now available during normal gameplay
-   Breeding cooldown is no longer reset after roll-up
-   Spiders and Cave Spiders now fear Armadillos even when experiments are turned on ([MCPE-178887](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-178887))

## Blocks

-   Sweet Berry Bush now drops up to 6 Sweet Berries when mined using a Fortune enchanted tool ([MCPE-172622](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-172622))
-   Fully grown Cocoa Pods now consistently drop 3 Cocoa Beans
-   Double Slabs can once again be created when stacking two of the same Slabs together ([MCPE-179187](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-179187))

## Gameplay

-   Fixed vertical position of tamed mobs from the clients/guests perspective after they teleport to their owner ([MCPE-139168](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-139168))
-   Horses and Boats no longer slide to unexpected previous locations upon mounting or dismounting

## Realms Stories

-   Fixed an issue where the Realms Stories button would lose focus on the play screen
-   The Members and Timeline tabs are now limited to rendering at most 300 Realm players, to avoid performance issues on large Realms. All players will still be searchable in the Members tab
-   When adding a new story, the text box is no longer cleared when the player leaves the Add Story screen. Essentially, players can save a draft of their Story
-   When posting a Realm Story, the player’s avatar will only have the Online badge if they’re currently playing in a game hosted by a Realm
-   Fixed the Realms Stories ‘Opt In’ screen sometimes appearing visually broken
-   Fixed a bug where selecting the same screenshot again would de-select the screenshot instead of just keeping the selected one
-   Added screen reader narration to Realms Stories ‘Opt In’ screen
-   Added info button to Timeline tab
-   Updated description text of certain Realms Stories settings
-   Added unread story indicator on Story Feed tab
-   Added a Realms Stories page to How to Play section of Minecraft

## User Interface

-   The feedback button has been moved from Main Menu to the Settings screen under the General tab with label “Help Center”
-   Added a toggle for enabling/disabling game tips and a button for restarting them in the Settings under the General section
-   Increased the time interval for showing a standard loading tip
-   Add “Import Retail Worlds” button to the Settings/Storage screen
-   Increased range for the “move up” button, such that you can now slide off slowly to the near buttons without stopping the movement ([MCPE-178399](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-178399))
-   Worlds imported in the new Play screen now has a space before the “(imported)” suffix (Preview only)
-   On touch devices, when items are swapped the icons now move in the correct direction
-   Custom Decorated Pots and dyed Banners are now rendered correctly in Crafter output slot
-   On touch devices, the selected item now has a blue background on all screens
-   Flying item animation is no longer missing in touch-screen versions of Beacon, Cartography, and Smithing Table screens
