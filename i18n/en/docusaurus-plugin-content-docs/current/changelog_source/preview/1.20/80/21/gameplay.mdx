## **Features and Bug Fixes:**

Eight new wolf variations have come to Minecraft! Read about each one in this [paw-some article](https://www.minecraft.net/article/new-minecraft-wolves).

The variant is determined by the biome they spawn in:

-   Pale Wolf - The familiar Wolf variant that now spawns in the Taiga biome, with a default pack size of 4
-   Woods Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Forest biome. This will be the dominant Wolf variant that you will be able to find in the Overworld, since the Forest biome is very common
-   Ashen Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Snowy Taiga biome
-   Black Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Old Growth Pine Taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
-   Chestnut Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Old Growth Spruce Taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
-   Rusty Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves - the Sparse Jungle biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
-   Spotted Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves - the Savanna Plateau biome, in larger packs of 4 to 8
-   Striped Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves, the Wooded Badlands biome, in larger packs of 4 to 8
-   Snowy Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Grove biome. A rare type, that always walks alone

## **Updated ‘Servers Tab’ Experience in Bedrock Preview**

The latest Bedrock Preview revamps the Server Tab in the Play Screen presenting Featured Servers and other servers you add. You will get to enjoy Featured Servers from our partners with exclusive environments, in a new visual style.
