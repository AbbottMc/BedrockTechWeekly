The mace is smashing its way into your worlds! Use its smash attack while falling and time it just right to knock back your enemies – the longer you fall, the stronger the blow! Craft this new weapon by combining a breeze rod with the heavy core, a new item you can find by unlocking trial chamber vaults.

Alongside the mace this week there are also new pottery sherds to collect, new armor trims to covet, and new banner designs to decorate your base with! Show the world (and your server) that you’ve bested the trial chambers with the flow or bolt armor trims. Declare yourself a breeze fan with two new banner designs, or bring a piece of the trial chambers home with new pottery sherd designs – all in testing now!

Your continued feedback is really helping shape the 1.21 update! Please let us know what you think at [feedback.minecraft.net](https://feedback.minecraft.net) and report any bugs you find on [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com).  
  

## **Experimental Features:**

## **Mace**

-   A new heavy weapon to smash your enemies!
-   Leverage the weight of this new weapon to deal additional damage the farther you fall before hitting your target
    -   Try it out by jumping down toward your target, and hit them before you hit the ground
    -   Successfully striking a target in this way will negate any damage accumulated from the fall, similar to how a Wind Charge works
    -   Other entities near the struck enemy will be knocked back by the immense force of the Mace
-   Using a Mace will decrease its durability like any other weapon; repair it with Breeze Rods at an Anvil
-   Players can use a Mace in combination with Wind Charges to launch up and deliver devastating smash attacks on their enemies
-   We'd love to hear your feedback on the Mace at [aka.ms/mcmacefeedback](https://aka.ms/mcmacefeedback)
