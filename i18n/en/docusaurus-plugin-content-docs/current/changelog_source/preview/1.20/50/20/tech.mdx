### **Editor**

-   Added eventing support for _ExtensionContext_ API

-   Added new after event _ModeChangeAfterEvent_ and signal _ModeChangeAfterEventSignal_

-   Fixed a bug where Cube Brush preview wasn't getting cleared when swapping to Crosshair mid-brush painting 

## Add-Ons and Script Engine

-   Improved some of the common scripting error messages to provide better context and information

## Animations

-   Fixed unreliability around _query.is\_alive_ on Server

## Blocks

-   Blocks with the "minecraft:cardinal\_direction", "minecraft:facing\_direction", or "minecraft:block\_face" states as part of the "minecraft:placement\_direction" or "minecraft:placement\_position" BlockTraits are rotated/mirrored properly by Structure Blocks
-   Structure Void blocks once again prevents interaction with blocks and entities placed behind them ([MCPE-175237](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-175237 "https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-175237"))
-   "planks" block is now split into unique instances "oak\_planks", "spruce\_planks", "birch\_planks", "jungle\_planks", "acacia\_planks", "dark\_oak\_planks"
-   Commands will still work with "planks", however, "planks" block will not be suggested 
-   "stone" block is now split into unique instances: "stone", "granite", "polished\_granite", "diorite", "polished\_diorite", "andesite" and "polished\_andesite" 

## Cameras

-   Added a content warning for when the camera is placed outside of the player's chunk radius 

## AI Goal Components

-   Added "minecraft:behavior.melee\_box\_attack" behavior which functions the same as "minecraft:behavior.melee\_attack" but uses bounds based attack reach calculations

-   The _reach\_multiplier_ attribute is removed and replaced with _box\_increase_
-   Reach is calculated by increasing the bounds of the attacking mobs in the xz-plane by _box\_increase_ blocks to create an "attack box". If the attack box intersects with the target's bounds the attacking mob can reach it

## Components

-   Added "minecraft:can\_join\_raid" component to allow entities to join existing raids

## Items

-   Deprecated the "tag:" legacy item component and released the "minecraft:tags" item component out of experimental in json formats 1.20.50 and higher

## Mobs

-   Fixed an issue preventing mobs from spawning further than 6 chunks away from the nearest player even if the server's simulation range is larger than 6 chunks ([MCPE-102197)](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-102197)

## Molang

-   Fixed animation controller loading to use the pack's _min\_engine\_version_ rather than the file's _format\_version_ to determine the Molang Version. This fix applies to animation controllers in packs with a _min\_engine\_version_ of 1.20.50 or higher 
-   The following Molang queries are Deprecated and will no longer be available in packs with a _min\_engine\_version_ of 1.20.50 or higher
    
    -   Replaced with _query.timer\_flag\_1_, set by _behavior.timer\_flag\_1_
    
    -   Replaced with _query.timer\_flag\_2_, set by _behavior.timer\_flag\_2_
    
    -   Replaced with _query.timer\_flag\_3_, set by _behavior.timer\_flag\_3_
    
    -   It was only used to adjust the head animation of the camel as it came out of dash cooldown
    -   Camel animation uses _variable.dash\_cooldown\_progress_ in camel.entity.json now

-   _query.is\_scenting_
-   _query.is\_rising_
-   _query.is\_feeling\_happy_
-   _query.dash\_cooldown\_progress_

## Stability and Performance

-   Removed _CraftingEventPacket_
