I am feeling particularly crafty today. Is it because I spent the morning scribbling cunning redstone plans on post-it notes? Or could it be **because the crafter is available for experimental testing in today’s Preview?** Revealed at Minecraft Live on October 15, the crafter uses redstone for automated crafting. Pick a recipe, add stacks of ingredients, supply a redstone pulse, and _tada!_ In just a few ticks, your auto-crafted item will _pop_ out into the Minecraft world. This is one of the first 1.21 features going into testing, and we’d really like your feedback to help us _craft_ this into its final iteration. Send your feedback [here](https://aka.ms/Minecraft121Feedback) and report bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/)!

_(Please note: This Preview and Beta will be rolling out to players around 09:00PDT)_
