_Whoosh_! Did you hear that? No, it wasn’t the sound of a poison arrow (more on _that_ later) – it was the wind charge, which is coming to Bedrock Edition preview and betas TODAY. The wind charge is an item that lets you harness some of the breeze’s powers – like being able to leap extra high, and shoot gusts of wind at your enemies to deal impact damage _and_ knockback. Dropped by defeated breezes, I’m going to use my wind charge to jump straight to: the bogged! The bogged is a new hostile mob that can spawn in the trial chambers, and attacks with poison-tipped arrow. The bogged might be slightly weaker than their skeleton cousins, but what they lack in speed, they make up for in damage! Face up against the bogged, test the new wind charge and more in today’s preview and beta for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

Here’s a list of what’s new. As always, we love to hear your feedback, so please let us know what you think [here](https://aka.ms/mcvaultsfeedback), and report any bugs you may encounter at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/).

-   Wind Charges have a max stack size of 64
-   There is half a second cooldown after each use
-   Wind Charges can be fired from a dispenser
