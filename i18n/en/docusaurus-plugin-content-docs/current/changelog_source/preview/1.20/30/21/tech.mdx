## **Graphics**

-   Added a new experimental toggle to Video menu for players on Windows which reduces input latency; enabling this setting will increase battery consumption

## **Editor**

The Editor and its corresponding API are in early development, and available for keyboard/mouse on Windows PC Bedrock Preview builds. Tag us on social channels with **#BedrockEditor.**

Learn [how to use](https://aka.ms/LearnEditor) the Editor, join the [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor/discussions) discussion forum to engage with the team, and get started building extensions via the [starter kit](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor-extension-starter-kit) and [samples](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor-extension-samples).

Fixes this week:

-   Fixed infinite gizmo drag and bugs around gizmo drag size, setting it as a limit to 100 units. How this works: Total volume of 100x100x100. Ability to create multiple selections within the bounds of the 100x100x100 total volumes.

## **Stability and Performance**

-   The game no longer crashes when it tries to place an invalid custom feature
