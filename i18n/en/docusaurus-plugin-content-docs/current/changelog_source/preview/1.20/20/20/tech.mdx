## **Add-Ons and Script Engine**

-   Render controllers without textures will now result in a content error and be ignored
-   Added support for the "_allow\_random\_seed_" option in world template manifests

This week marks the release of **v0.4: The Editor API Update!** While still in early development, we’ve released it with the following support:

-   Editor Extensions [overview article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/editorextensionsintroduction) and [API reference documentation](https://aka.ms/EditorAPI) on learn.microsoft.com
-   [Starter Kit](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor-extension-starter-kit): Contains the compiler tools and various libraries required to get started making Editor Extensions
-   [Samples](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor-extension-samples) created by our team to jump-start your own Extension creations

Additional fixes this week to the general Editor experience:

-   Fixed a bug where number slider thumbs in the tool panes were extending beyond the boundaries of the pane.
-   Fixed a bug where clicking on the selected tool in the tool rail was not re-opening the closed tool pane.
-   Fixed an issue where structure void, light, and barrier blocks were only visible when the player was holding them – now they’re always visible in the Editor.
-   Fixed a bug that caused the player's body to not rotate in third-person view when the simulation is paused.
-   Improved logging and moved operation chat notifications to the log panel.
-   Fixed selection gizmo visibility when there is no active selection. Previously, when there was no selection volume, selection arrow gizmos were being rendered at the world origin (0,0,0).
-   The selected theme will now be correctly applied to external links in the Help tab of the Quick Start panel.
-   Removed the non-functional hamburger menu button from the Quick Panel tabs.
