## **Add-Ons and Script Engine**

## **Commands**

-   Has item command selector now correctly detects whether or not an actor has a filled Map or Firework Star in their inventory

## **Bedrock Editor**

-   Fixed a bug where the default command permission level of the client differed from what was displayed in a multiplayer session
