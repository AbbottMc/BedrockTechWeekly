Do you tend to play Minecraft by spawning in and _thwacking_ the first hostile mob you see? Then I have good news for you! You can now protect yourself in style with a new feature: the customizable shield. This parity feature not only brings shield banner customization to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, but gives you a _very_ fashionable (if somewhat flammable) defence tool. Just combine your shield with your favorite banner, and away you go. There are also new potions colors (ooo, distinguishable!), new sniffer breeding mechanics (ooo eggs!) and even a brand-new seed for your newly de-experimentified sniffer friends to seek out: the pitcher pod! As always, don’t forget to send us all your feedback and ideas at [aka.ms/MC120Feedback](http://aka.ms/MC120Feedback) and report any bugs to [bugs.mojang.com](http://bugs.mojang.com/).
