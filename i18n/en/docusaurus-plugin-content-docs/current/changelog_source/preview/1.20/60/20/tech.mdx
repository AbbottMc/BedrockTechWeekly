## **Script API**

<Switcher techSapi={<TechSapiStable/>} techSapiDiff={undefined}/>

## Editor

The Editor and its corresponding API are in early development, and available for keyboard/mouse on Windows PC Bedrock Preview builds. Tag us on social channels with **#BedrockEditor.**

Learn [**how to use**](https://aka.ms/LearnEditor) the Editor, join the [**GitHub Discussion**](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor/discussions) discussion forum to engage with the team, and get started building extensions via the [**starter kit**](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor-extension-starter-kit) and [**samples**](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor-extension-samples).

Updates this week:

-   Fixed editor screen freeze bug caused by CTRL+TAB shortcut. 
-   New API! Simulation paused state is now available for editor scripting via the editor global object's simulation property. 
-   Menu items now have a checked property, of type boolean | undefined. If the value is defined, the menu will show a checkmark if the value is true.
-   Added an \`all\` optional parameter to the \`/reload\` slash command when running in Editor mode which enables a full warm reload of the entire Editor. 

## Entity Components

-   Entity event response run\_command has been renamed to queue\_command and has been released out of experimental. Commands run via queue\_command may be deferred until the next tick. If the entity is removed before the command is run, the command will not execute. Content using run\_command under experimental will still work for now but the experimental feature is now considered deprecated

## Items

-   Unrecognized fields in component item jsons will now give a warning to the content log in format versions 1.20.60 and higher

## Loot Tables

-   Decorated Pots now support the use of loot tables
