## **Script API**

<Switcher techSapi={<TechSapiStable/>} techSapiDiff={undefined}/>

## **Blocks**

-   Added the ability for data-driven blocks to remove faces in the geometry when abutting a full and opaque block. A new field has been added to the Block Geometry Component, which references a new Culling .json file (found in the resource pack block\_culling directory) that sets up culling rules for the tessellated geometry 

## **Dimension API**

-   _setWeather_ method argument duration now uses _ArgumentOutOfBoundsError_ Error type

## **Editor**

The Editor and its [corresponding API](https://aka.ms/EditorAPI) are in early development, and available for keyboard/mouse on Windows PC Bedrock Preview builds. Tag us on social channels with **#BedrockEditor**.

Learn [how to use](https://www.aka.ms/LearnEditor) the Editor, join the [GitHub Discussion forum](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor/discussions) to engage with the team, and get started building extensions via the [starter kit](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor-extension-starter-kit) and [samples](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor-extension-samples).

## **Commands**

-   Healthbar of mounted rideable mobs is now properly displayed ([MCPE-177696](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-177696))
-   Execute command now fails when comparing unloaded blocks ([MCPE-177195](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-177195))
-   Hud command now works as expected – the /hud command allows creators to show/hide each element individually as well as show/hide all. Hiding one element no longer hides 'all' elements.

## **Graphical**

-   Fixed an issue causing caves to appear illuminated by the sun (aka “Light Leaking”) in the Deferred Technical Preview
-   Volumetric fog is no longer affected by sunlight in enclosed spaces in the Deferred Technical Preview
