## **Dedicated Server**

-   Fixed invalid entries in allowlist.json causing crash ([BDS-18133](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/BDS-18133))

## **Add-Ons and Script Engine**

-   Actually fixed the bug that caused player capes to stop flapping when moving forward but looking sideways in the query.cape\_flap\_amount by switching the rotation used from the player's looking rotation to the player's body rotation ([MCPE-153446](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-153446))
-   Observer blocks use state "minecraft:facing\_direction" instead of "facing\_direction". "minecraft:facing\_direction" uses string values ("down", "up", "north", "south", "east", "west")

## **Entities**

-   Custom entities are no longer restricted to overriding Vanilla entities released before 1.20. All Vanilla entities can be used in the "identifier" or "runtime\_identifier" field, including Camel and Sniffer.

## **Experimental Cameras**

-   Camera preset JSON now supports an optional bool 'player\_effects' value which causes game rendering to use player effect state (for example night vision) when this preset is active. Added the "example:example\_player\_effects" preset to demonstrate this
-   Camera command can now take a 'facing' option instead of a 'rot' option with a target entity or position specified
-   Fixed custom cameras to not use the 'inside block' effect when player head is inside a block ([MCPE-170206](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-170206))

## **Items**

-   Deprecate "minecraft:render\_offsets" component in json formats 1.20.10 and higher
-   Changed charging action behavior in "minecraft:shooter" to match Vanilla crossbow Changed shooting behavior for a charged "minecraft:shooter" with an empty inventory/offhand to successfully shoot the charged ammunition
