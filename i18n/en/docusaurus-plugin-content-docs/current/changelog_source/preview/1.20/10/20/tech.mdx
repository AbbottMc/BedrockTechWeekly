## **Add-Ons and Script Engine**

-   Added deprecation error message for the _part\_visibility_component (the _bone\_visibility_ field in the geometry component should be used instead, see block documentation for more information)
-   Fixed an issue where adding a _minecraft:peek_component to a custom entity would cause the game to crash

## **Blocks**

-   Updated the "minecraft:geometry" block component to allow bone visibility to be defined with a Molang expression

## **Commands**

-   Executing the "inputpermission set" command will now output a message to the chat with the results ([MCPE-168368](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-168368))
-   Executing the "inputpermission set" command will now result in an error if it does not affect any players
-   Command positions will now use the current position/rotation when running mcfunctions via execute
-   Fixed issue where some execute commands stopped working on Realms ([MCPE-169974](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-169974))
-   The "hasitem" target selector argument now counts items held with the cursor ([MCPE-152002](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-152002))
-   Commands will still work with "concrete", but "concrete" won't be suggested in the command prompt, rather the new names will
    -   "concrete" block is now split into unique instances, namely "white\_concrete", "orange\_concrete", "magenta\_concrete", "light\_blue\_concrete", "yellow\_concrete", "lime\_concrete", "pink\_concrete", "gray\_concrete", "light\_gray\_concrete", "cyan\_concrete", "purple\_concrete", "blue\_concrete", "brown\_concrete", "green\_concrete", "red\_concrete", and "black\_concrete"
-   Java Parity: Block states in commands will use equals instead of colon in version 1.20.0 and later. For example using the setblock command: /setblock ~ ~ ~ oak\_log\["pillar\_axis"="x"\] ([MCPE-168056](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-168056))
-   Block states with equals don't require a space to show autocomplete options ([MCPE-168056](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-168056))

## **Components**

-   Added a content error when _minecraft:balloonable_ is used on _minecraft:player_ to prevent issues as this component is not supported in this way ([MCPE-164495](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-164495))
