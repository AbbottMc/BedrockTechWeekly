# **Experimental Features**

## **Recipe Unlocking**

-   We tested having a notification that informed you about new ways of creating recipes you’ve already unlocked. It didn’t feel helpful. Do you know how many ways there are to make sticks?! Yeah, a lot. We are removing this version of the unlocking notification
