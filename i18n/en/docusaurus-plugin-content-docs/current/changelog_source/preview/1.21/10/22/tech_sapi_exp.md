-   Added _playerEmote_ which fires after a player uses an emote
-   Block Custom Components
    -   Use of the ‘onTick’ event requires the block has the ‘minecraft:tick’ component to configure how the block ticks
    -   Blocks that are world generated, and have the ‘minecraft:tick’ component, will now tick
