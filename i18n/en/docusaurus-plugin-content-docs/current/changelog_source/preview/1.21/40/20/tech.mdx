## Add-Ons and Script Engine

-   Fixed a bug where using "bone\_visibility" for a block geometry would cause the "item\_display\_transforms" not to be applied properly ([MCPE-185868](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-185868))
-   Fixed issue which prevented the new 1.21.30 trade table format from loading in-game

## Commands

-   Added new overloads for the `schedule` command which allows you to clear a queued function 
    -   `/schedule clear \<function name\>` - Clears all queued functions matching the given name
    -   `/schedule on_area_loaded clear function \<function name\>` - Clears all queued functions that are scheduled as `on_area_load` by name
    -   `/schedule on_area_loaded clear tickingarea \<tickingarea name\> [function name]` - Clears all queued functions that are scheduled as `on_area_load` by ticking area name (and optionally also checks function name too)

## Components

-   The "restriction\_type" field has been added to the "minecraft:home" component, allowing to define how an entity is restricted to its home position:
    -   Its values are:
        -   "none", which poses no restriction
        -   "random\_movement", which restricts randomized movement around the home position
        -   "all\_movement", which restricts any kind of movement around the home position
    -   The "all\_movement" value is currently in \[Beta\] and is planned to be fully released at a later date
    -   Entities that have moved too far from their home will always be able to move closer to it if prompted
    -   The radius of the restriction is still specified with "restriction\_radius"
    -   Entities with a format version prior to 1.21.40 will be upgraded to use the new field in a way that preserves their existing behavior
-   Added the "minecraft:dimension\_bound" component, which prevents entities from changing dimension through portals 
    -   In Vanilla content, this is used by the Ender Dragon, the Fishing Hook, and some projectiles
-   Added the "minecraft:transient" component, entities with this component will never be saved. In Vanilla content, this is currently used for the Fishing Hook 

## Editor

-   Added block picking for the current block palette on middle mouse click
-   Added custom block textures to now support in block images
-   Added resource access protocol "block://\<block\_name\>" to retrieve block images 
-   Added new API interface `IStatusBar` to manage `IStatusBarItem` objects. It can be accessed from `statusBar` property on `IPlayerUISession`.
    -   Added `IStatusBarItemCreationParams` for status bar item initialization
    -   Removed `text` property from `IStatusBarItem` in favor of `getText` and `setText` functions. Added localization support for text content
    -   Renamed `EditorStatusBarAlignment` to `StatusBarAlignment`
-   Renamed 'Input Mapping' to 'Keyboard Settings' action bar item and improved modal panel visuals 
-   Fixed a bug related to losing the block palette setting of simple blocks in hotbar between suspend/resume of application 
-   Fixed a bug where Quick Start panel visibility was not persisted correctly
-   Fixed a bug so the hotbar fills with a list of default blocks rather than all air when creating a new editor world

## Entity Components

-   "behavior.fire\_at\_target" is no longer usable if it is missing a projectile definition and will now throw a content error if so

## Entity Event Responses

-   Added the "execute\_event\_on\_home\_block" entity event response, which allows the entity to execute an event on the block at its home position
    -   The "event" field allows to specify the event to execute
    -   For this to work properly, the entity must have a "minecraft:home" component with a set home position

## General

-   Made the following changes to 'minecraft:single\_block\_feature'
    -   'places\_block' now supports a list of weighted block specifiers
    -   New 'randomize\_rotation' property
    -   New 'may\_not\_attach\_to' placement conditions
    -   Added 'diagonal' as a new option for 'may\_attach\_to' conditions
    -   File format version increased to 1.21.40

## Graphical

-   Fixed bug where the tessellation of Redstone dust does not match the powered state of the dust for the following blocks: 
    -   minecraft:\*\_slab
    -   minecraft:chain
    -   minecraft:chorus\_flower
    -   minecraft:chorus\_plant
    -   minecraft:farmland
    -   minecraft:grass\_path
    -   minecraft:heavy\_core
    -   minecraft:jigsaw
    -   minecraft:sea\_lantern
    -   minecraft:sniffer\_egg
    -   minecraft:structure\_block

## Molang

-   Molang queries "wing\_flap\_position" and "wing\_flap\_speed" now work for the Chicken 

## Resource and Behavior Packs

-   Built-in packs now include archive files for improved load performance on some platforms 

## Stability and Performance

-   Increased the size of biome ids in saved chunk data from 8 bit to 16 bit values
-   Fixed a bug where extremely fast moving entities would cause the game to crash. Entities can now no longer move more than 16 blocks in a single tick. (For reference, an entity with Speed 255 will move ~11 blocks in a single tick.)
-   Game will no longer crash when loading a world near an End City

## Cameras

-   Fixed an issue where `rider_rotation_lock` of `minecraft:rideable` had no effect when using the `minecraft:follow_orbit` camera
-   Added `minecraft:camera_attach_to_player` to `minecraft:follow_orbit`
-   Added `align_target_and_camera_forward` option to the camera preset behavior pack JSON which can be used when the third person camera preset experiment is enabled
-   3rd person camera experiment - The radius property of the creator cameras is now constrained to a value between 0.1 and 100 
-   Third person boom camera will now reset to the starting rotation values specified in json when the 'default' parameter is passed in the camera command

## Graphical

-   Removed the dark aura around the moon in the Deferred Technical Preview
