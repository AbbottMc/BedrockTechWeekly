![New Chicken variants in a desert village.](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/34063162908429)

Apologies if all the clucking is distracting you from this changelog, but two new chicken variants have just joined the coop! The cold chicken and the warm chicken spawn in their respective climates, drop different colored eggs, and cause all kinds of chaos. Uh-oh, I think they are in fact about to escape their pen! I’ll quickly tell you that pink cactus flowers and two types of dry grass are now sprouting in sandy biomes. Oh, and we’ve squashed some bugs too!

# Experimental Features

## Cactus Flower

-   Added the Cactus Flower, a new type of flower which has a chance of generating on Cactuses in Deserts and Badlands
-   Cactus Flower can be placed on Cactus blocks or any block which has center support at the top of the block
-   Cactus Flowers have a chance of growing on Cactus blocks
    -   If a Cactus is 1-2 blocks high the Cactus Flower has a 10% chance to grow instead of the Cactus getting higher
    -   If a Cactus is 3 blocks high the Cactus Flower has a 25% chance to grow instead of the Cactus getting higher
-   Cactus Flowers can be used in the Composter
-   A Cactus Flower can be used to craft 1 Pink Dye

## Chicken Variants

-   Added two new Chicken variants - Warm Chicken and Cold Chicken!
-   These have their own unique texture and geometry, but not a separate spawn egg
-   They spawn in the same biomes as the Warm, Cold, and Temperate variants of Pigs and Cows
-   Two new Egg items have been added for the Warm and Cold Chicken variants
    -   Blue Egg - The Egg that is laid by and can hatch Cold Chicken variants
    -   Brown Egg - The Egg that is laid by and can hatch Warm Chicken variants

    -   Using Bone Meal on Short Dry Grass grows it into a Tall Dry Grass

-   Both can be used in the Composter
-   Sheep can eat both to regrow its wool
