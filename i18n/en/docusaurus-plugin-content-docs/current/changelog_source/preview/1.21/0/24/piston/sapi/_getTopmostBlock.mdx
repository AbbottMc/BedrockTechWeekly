The new method `getTopmostBlock` is designed to facilitate obtaining the highest block at a given (x, z) coordinate position.

### Syntax

```typescript
getTopmostBlock(locationXZ: VectorXZ, minHeight?: number): Block | undefined;
```

- `locationXZ`： An instance object conforming to the VectorXZ interface pattern, comprising two properties: x and z.
- `minHeight`： An optional parameter representing the minimum height, with a default value of the minimum height of the world.

Returns an instance object of [Block](/docs/sapi/preview/server/classes/Block), representing the highest point block. If no such highest block exists, returns `undefined`.


### Example

When a player interacts with a block, this function retrieves the highest point block at the block's (x, z) position.

```typescript
import {MinecraftDimensionTypes, VectorXZ, world} from "@minecraft/server"
const overworld = world.getDimension(MinecraftDimensionTypes.overworld);

// Subscribe events of player-block interactions in the game.
world.afterEvents.playerInteractWithBlock.subscribe(({block}) => {
  // Obtain the (x, z) position of the player's interacting block, and store it as a new VectorXZ type
  const location: VectorXZ = {x: block.x, y: block.y};
  // Get the highest point block at the (x, z) position
  const topmostBlock = overworld.getTopmostBlock(location);
  // Output the information of the highest point block
  console.warn(`The topmost block at (${location.x}, ${location.y}) is "${topmostBlock.typeId}"`);
});
```
