-   Fixed issue where block with custom components could not have a block placed onto them without crouching

-   Added method `getBlockAbove` which will perform a raycast from a given position, trying to find the first solid block above
-   Added method `getBlockBelow` which will perform a raycast from a given position, trying to find the first solid block below
