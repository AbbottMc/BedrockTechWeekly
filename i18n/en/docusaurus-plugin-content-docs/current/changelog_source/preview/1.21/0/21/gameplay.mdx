We always talk about squashing bugs in our changelogs, but this week we’re doing it with an enchanted mace for _extra_ squashing power! Test out the Density, Breach, and Wind Burst enchantments, which are all unique to the mace, and see which fits your combat style the best. Just mind you don’t smash any of the walls of your base, because you might want to decorate them with another feature included in this testing release – five new Minecraft paintings. From blocky baroque stills to even blockier landscapes, this changelog has more ways to decorate your base _and_ more ways to smash it all to pieces. Let’s dive in!

Here’s a list of what’s new in this week’s Preview and Beta! We’d love your feedback, as always, so please let us know what you think at [feedback.minecraft.net](https://feedback.minecraft.net), and report any bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](http://bugs.mojang.com/).

# Experimental Features

## Mace

-   The Mace now has three brand new Enchantments available for use! 
    -   **Wind Burst** generates a burst of wind when successfully striking enemies, launching the wielder in the air!
    -   **Density** makes the already heavy Mace EVEN HEAVIER, adding additional heft to its Smash Attack!
    -   **Breach** allows the Mace to bypass a portion of an enemy's Armor, striking fear into the hearts of even the most protected enemies!
-   Added a new explosive particle effect when executing a smash attack with the Mace to really show the player's power when using it! 
-   Known issues: Particles appear grey in water and on some leaves. Particles appear when target is hit in the air.

## Mob Effects

-   Added Raid Omen 
    -   Instead of triggering a Raid directly, Bad Omen will transform into a Raid Omen variant with a duration of 30 seconds
    -   Once the Raid Omen expires, a Raid will start at the location the player gained the Raid Omen
    -   Like any other effect, players can drink a Bucket of Milk to clear the Raid Omen to prevent the Raid from starting
-   Added activation sounds to Bad Omen, Trial Omen, and Raid Omen

## Paintings
