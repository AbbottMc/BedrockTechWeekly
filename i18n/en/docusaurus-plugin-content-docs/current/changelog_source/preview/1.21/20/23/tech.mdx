    -   Future work will add the ability to create, modify, and delete custom themes but the default themes will not be modifiable
-   Updated subset of PropertyPane API to use IObservable pattern.
    -   Added an alternative Property Pane _addVector3_API that leverages type safe _IObservable_ Observables can be created using _makeObservable_ API

        -   Renamed function to create property bag Vector3 to _addVector3\_deprecated_
    -   Added an alternative Property Pane _addBool_API that leverages type safe _IObservableProp_ value API

        -   Renamed function to create property bag bool item to _addBool\_deprecated_
    -   Converted Property Pane addText API to use _IObservableProp_

    -   Renamed _EDITOR\_PANE\_PROPERTY\_ITEM\_TYPE_enum API to _PropertyItemType_

        -   Added _onClick_function and _alignment_ property to _IImagePropertyItemOptions_ API

## Entity Components

-   Improved "behavior.follow\_owner" teleportation logic: 
    -   Entities now seamlessly resume navigation after teleporting to their owner
    -   Added the "post\_teleport\_distance" field, allowing to specify how far from its owner an entity will be placed after teleporting
        -   If no value is specified, "stop\_distance" increased by one will be used
    -   These changes only affect entities with format version of 1.21.20 or above
