Greetings, dear readers! This week, we begin the 1.21.20.21 Betas and Previews, and we know that many of you who follow the update versions closely will be expecting a retail update soon. However, after careful consideration we have decided that we will be skipping the 1.21.10 update. Instead, we will focus on 1.21.20 to prioritize more quality and stability improvements. But fear not – all of the tweaks from recent Betas and Previews won't be lost! They will also be included in 1.21.20, and we will be assessing and addressing critical bugs in hotfixes as we did with 1.21.1. Thank you for your patience and understanding, and please keep sending us your feedback and bug reports. We really appreciate your input!

Here’s the list for what’s new this week:

## Updated Realms Tab

We’ve introduced a brand-new Realms tab. It is found in the New Play Screen, but unfortunately there is an issue with actually joining a Realm this way! (Sorry!) You will have to switch to the old UI in order to join Realms in the Preview - we hope to have this issue resolved as soon as possible.

Here’s what you can expect showing up over next couple of previews:

-   List of Realms: Easily view all the Realms you own or have joined.
-   Start Playing: Launch your Realm directly from this screen.
-   Online Player Count: See how many players are currently online in each Realm.
-   Realm Management: Take control of your owned Realms by editing worlds and managing subscriptions.
-   Add or Join Realms: Explore new Realms by adding or joining them.
-   Realm Stories: View Realm stories.

We’ll continue improving the Realms tab in future releases. Please send us your feedback at [aka.ms/realmstabfeedback](https://aka.ms/realmstabfeedback)
