This week’s preview is _very exciting_. Why? Because parrots can finally imitate Endermites! Wait, sorry, that wasn’t the big news. I mean – because bundles are now available for testing in pre-release versions of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition! Bundles are an item that let you store stacks of other items together, which helps you maximize your inventory space. You can even store bundles in bundles! And once you’ve stuffed your bundle with bundles of other bundles, you can now use new tooltip to choose which item or stack of items to extract. As always, we’d love your feedback on bundles (and on parrots imitating Endermites, if you’d like), so please let us know what you think at [aka.ms/mcbundlesfeedback](https://aka.ms/mcbundlesfeedback), and report any bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](http://bugs.mojang.com/).

# Experimental Features

## Bundles

A Bundle is an item that lets you stack different blocks or items together in the same inventory slot. Different items normally don’t stack together, so you can end up wasting space by only having a few items in each slot. A Bundle lets you pack those items together so there is no wasted space.

-   Bundles are an experimental feature - to use them, you must turn on the Bundle experiment when creating a new world
-   A Bundle is an item that can pack different items together into the same stack
-   A Bundle only fits one stack (usually 64 items) but it can be a mixture of many different item types
-   You can insert items into a Bundle directly in the inventory
-   Bundles have a tooltip that shows the items inside
    -   If a Bundle has less than 8 item types inside, the tooltip will show all of them
    -   Otherwise, the tooltip will show the top two rows of items and the others will be hidden below
-   You can select any of the visible items to pull out of the Bundle
    -   Use the scroll wheel on mouse, the right stick on a game controller, or tap on a touch device

\> **Developer's Note:** _In the original Bundle experiment, you could only pick the top item. We got a lot of feedback that players wanted more flexibility when taking items out. To address this we put a submenu inside the Bundle, which has never been done before in Minecraft!_

-   When selecting an item to remove, the Bundle icon shows that item poking out of the Bundle
-   When holding a Bundle in hand, you can empty it onto the ground
-   The Bundle is crafted with one String above one Leather

\> **Developer's Note:** _The original prototype for Bundles was much more expensive to craft and used Rabbit Hide, which is only available in certain biomes, so the player had to explore to get their first Bundle. In this version we've made it cheaper and something that you can craft at home in almost any biome. We want it to be easy to get Bundles in a new world so you can use it in your early adventures._

-   Known issues:
    -   The Bundle recipe may not appear as a suggested crafting item, but can still be crafted
    -   When moving items on touch devices, the wrong item icon may appear briefly
