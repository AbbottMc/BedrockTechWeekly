## Add-Ons and Script Engine

-   Fixed bug where all custom blocks were rotated 180 degrees in the UI
-   The default for the "gui" "item\_display\_transforms" "rotation" field is `[30, 45, 0]` instead of `[30, 225, 0]`
    -   "item\_display\_transforms": \{  
        "gui" : \{  
        "translation": \[0, 0, 0\],  
        "rotation": \[30, 45, 0\],  
        "scale": \[0.625, 0.625, 0.625\],  
        "rotation\_pivot" : \[0, 0, 0\],  
        "scale\_pivot" : \[0, 0, 0\],  
        "fit\_to\_frame" : true  
        \}  
        \}
