There’s a new Minecraft Preview and Beta rolling out, bringing fixes to disappearing boats, heat-resistant snow golems, and more! For those of you wondering about bundles – our developers are still working hard on bringing bundles into Preview and Beta, so keep your eyes peeled on future changelogs for updates!

Here’s what’s new in this week’s Preview and Beta:

# Features and Bug Fixes

## Blocks

-   Vertically retracting waterlogged blocks with a Piston no longer creates "ghost water" on the client ([MCPE-144222](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-144222))
-   "purpur\_block" block is now split into unique instances "purpur\_block", and "purpur\_pillar"; the previously unused chiseled and smooth purpur blocks were renamed to "deprecated\_purpur\_block\_1" and "deprecated\_purpur\_block\_2" for backwards compatibility, but are hidden from creative inventory and commands
-   "structure\_void" has had its block state removed and "air" variants will be converted to the base block
-   Added new vanilla block and item tags to support vanilla item tier level destruction speeds for data driven blocks
-   All Logs, Stripped Logs, Woods, and Stripped Woods are now treated consistently across various scenarios:
    -   Flying mobs that can land on trees will now recognize these blocks as suitable landing positions
    -   Parrots will now prefer these blocks as landing spots
    -   Previously, these behaviors applied to only a subset of these blocks
-   Kelp can no longer be placed on any type of Fence, instead of just a subset of them
-   Seagrass can no longer be placed on any type of Fence, instead of just a subset of them
-   Turtle Eggs can no longer be placed on any type of Fence, instead of just a subset of them
-   "cobblestone\_wall" block is now split into unique instances "cobblestone\_wall", "mossy\_cobblestone\_wall", "granite\_wall", "diorite\_wall", "andesite\_wall", "sandstone\_wall", "brick\_wall", "stone\_brick\_wall", "mossy\_stone\_brick\_wall", "nether\_brick\_wall", "end\_stone\_brick\_wall", "prismarine\_wall", "red\_sandstone\_wall" and "red\_nether\_brick\_wall" ()
-   "granite\_wall", "diorite\_wall", "andesite\_wall", "stone\_brick\_wall", "mossy\_stone\_brick\_wall" and "prismarine\_wall" now have a destruction time of 1.5
-   "sandstone\_wall" and "red\_sandstone\_wall" now have a destruction time of 0.8
-   "end\_stone\_brick\_wall" now has a destruction time of 3.0

## Crafting

-   When crafting a Firework, adding or removing items from the grid will update the output item appropriately ([MCPE-183455](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-183455))

-   Fixed a crash that could occur when opening a Lectern while a Sticky Piston was moving it. The Lectern now closes the book screen when moved ([MCPE-183508](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-183508))
-   Dismounting a vehicle no longer puts the player inside the ground on some platforms ([MCPE-184363](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-184363), [MCPE-182448](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-182448))

## Graphical

-   Fixed an issue where Banners were rendered before other transparent objects regardless of their positions ([MCPE-130262](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-130262))

## How to Play

-   Added line break ability for How to Play topic labels instead of having it add "..." when the line got too long

## Items

-   Each Banner Pattern item now includes their pattern type in their name instead of as a subtitle ([MCPE-182508](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-182508))
-   Smithing Template items are now named after their template type instead of the generic "Smithing Template" name
    -   They instead specify that they are a Smithing Template through a subtitle in the hover text
-   Unique item textures have been given to each Banner Pattern item to better distinguish between each other
-   Illager Banner has been renamed to Ominous Banner to match Java Edition

## Multiplayer

-   Fixed an issue where the invite screen in-game would not show the correct substatus

## Rarity

-   Various items and blocks have had their assigned rarities changed ([MCPE-182414](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-182414))
    -   Once these rarity changes come to Java Edition in a future snapshot, all item and block rarities will be in parity across both platforms
-   Rarity is a set of categories which determine the color used to display the name of an item or block
    -   It has no gameplay impact, but is used to signal how difficult something is to obtain
    -   By default, unless specified otherwise, all items and blocks have a rarity of Common which displays their name in the color white
-   We have re-evaluated the rarity of all items and blocks in the game to more accurately reflect the current challenge of obtaining them, given the following guidelines:
    -   Items and blocks become rarer depending on the following factors:
        -   The chance of finding it in a loot table, including mob drops
        -   The amount of travelling required to obtain it
        -   The difficulty of any obstacle which must be overcome to obtain it
        -   The possible amount of that item or block which exists in the world
    -   Any item or block which can be crafted must inherit the highest rarity of its crafting ingredients
        -   For example, a Mace has an Epic rarity because one of its ingredients (the Heavy Core) has an Epic rarity
        -   Likewise, any crafted item which has only Common crafting ingredients must also be Common
    -   The lists below detail the items and blocks which have changed to that rarity category

### Common

-   End Crystal
-   Golden Apple

### Epic

-   Elytra
-   Dragon Head
-   Silence Armor Trim

### Rare

-   Enchanted Golden Apple
    -   Enchanted Golden Apples have become more common in recent years due to being accessible in both Ancient Cities and Trial Chambers, warranting a demotion to Rare instead of Epic
-   Trident
    -   We recently increased Trident's rarity up to Epic from Common, but after re-evaluating we felt that it was easier to obtain than other items in the Epic category such as Heavy Cores or Elytra
-   Nether Star
-   Ward Armor Trim
-   Eye Armor Trim
-   Vex Armor Trim
-   Spire Armor Trim
-   Wither Skeleton Skull
-   Skull Charge Banner Pattern
    -   Now that Wither Skeleton Skulls are Rare, these banner patterns should be Rare as well

    -   Now that Enchanted Golden Apples are Rare, these banner patterns should be Rare as well
-   The following Music Discs:
    -   Pigstep
    -   otherside
    -   Creator

## Touch Controls

-   Fixed a bug where the hide hud command would not hide the d-pad touch control ([MCPE-184157](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-184157))

## Trial Chambers

-   Added new variations to the hallways, including "Encounters": Short challenges leading to a larger chamber.
-   Beds in intersections now have their colors randomized. ([MCPE-180424](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-180424))  
-   Replaced the empty chests at the entrance of chamber with a Hopper and Barrel to better show the players that these are meant for disposal and inventory management!

-   Fixed a bug where a standalone Scaffolding block could not be placed on top of a Structure Block ([MCPE-169818](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-169818))
