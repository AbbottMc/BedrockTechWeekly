## Items

-   Item data versioned 1.16.100+ can now be overridden by item data versioned 1.16.100+ higher in the pack stack 
-   Enables Creators to override 1.16.100+ data driven Vanilla items with 1.16.100+ data
-   Added "minecraft:storage\_item" item component to allow an item to store data of the dynamic container associated with it 
    -   This component requires that the Bundles toggle is enabled
    -   A dynamic container is a container for storing items that is linked to an item instead of a block or an entity
    -   To use this component the item must have "minecraft:max\_stack\_size" set to 1
    -   The "max\_slots" field (1 to 64) defines the number of slots of the dynamic container
    -   The "max\_weight\_limit" field defines the maximum allowed sum of the weight of the items in all slots of the dynamic container
        -   Items that stack to 64 weigh 1 each, those that stack to 16 weigh 4 each and unstackable items weigh 64
    -   The "allow\_nested\_storage\_items" field allows for other items with a "minecraft:storage\_item" component to be put inside it
    -   The "weight\_in\_storage\_item" (0 to 64) defines the additional weight the item adds when inside another storage item
        -   A value of 0 means that this item is not allowed inside another storage item
    -   The "banned\_items" field defines the items that are not allowed in the item's dynamic container
    -   The "allowed\_items" field defines the items that are exclusively allowed in the item's dynamic container
        -   If empty all items are allowed in the item's dynamic container
-   Added "minecraft:bundle\_interaction" item component to enable bundle-specific interaction scheme and tooltip 
    -   This component requires that the Bundles toggle is enabled
    -   To use this component the item must have a "minecraft:storage\_item" component defined
    -   The "minecraft:bundle\_interaction" component interacts with the container created by the "minecraft:storage\_item" component
    -   The "num\_viewable\_slots" field (1 to 64) defines the maximum number of item stacks accessible from the top of the bundle, while other slots are hidden
    -   Textures named \[item\_name\]\_open\_front and \[item\_name\]\_open\_back must be added to textures/textures\_list.json

## Trade Tables

-   The Trade Table files are now versioned 
    -   TradeTier's "total\_exp\_required" is a required member from version 1.21.30
    -   TradeTier's "groups" is a required member from version 1.21.30
