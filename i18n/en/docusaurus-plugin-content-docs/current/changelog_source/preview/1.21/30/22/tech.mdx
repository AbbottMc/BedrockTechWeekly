## **Script API**

<Switcher techSapi={<TechSapiStable/>} techSapiDiff={undefined}/>

## Graphical

-   Fixed a bug that caused moon to appear darker ([MCPE-172971](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-172971))
-   Fixed bug where culling rules for data driven blocks did not rotate with the transformation component 

## Resource and Behavior Packs

-   The player's "helmet\_layer\_visible" variable is now based on the result of the `has_head_gear` Molang query and the player and persona render controller's part visibility for the helmet layer no longer checks for the existence of head gear. This fixes attachable scripts setting the "helmet\_layer\_visible" to 1.0 to now properly work and maintains a fix that prevents persona hair and head gear from clipping outside of mob and Pumpkin heads  ([MCPE-183058](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-183058))
