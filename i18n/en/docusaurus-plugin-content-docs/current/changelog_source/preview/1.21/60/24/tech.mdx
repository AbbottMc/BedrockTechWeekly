## Blocks

-   Fixed issue where legacy data driven block didn't apply the render layer from the material instances component
-   Fix spurious content log error: 'trying to override the Geometry component with blocks.json settings for a custom block'
-   Door blocks use state `minecraft:cardinal_direction` instead of `minecraft:direction`. Uses string values ("north, south, east, west")

### Components

-   Moved the `minecraft:liquid_detection` component out of the Upcoming Creator Features experiment for format\_versions 1.21.60 and above

## Collisions

-   Entities with no collision box but with the `minecraft:custom_hit_test` component are no longer sometimes unable to be interacted with

## Components

-   Expand the `minecraft:breedable` component to allow inheriting properties to child entities  
    -   Adds the new "property\_inheritance" field which takes property name keyed objects
    -   The objects in property\_inheritance can contain a "mutation\_chance" which give the chance it should not inherit from either parent
    -   They can also contain the "mutation\_values" array of values to select from if mutating and the component has random mutation set

## Editor

-   Centers block thumbnail images in hotbar, block picker and lists
-   Adds data-driven rendering to editor block images
    -   Adds block name aliasing for signs
    -   Adds support for namespace block names for `block://` protocol
-   Player model is now fully hidden while in tool mode

## Fog

-   Fixed issue where "inherit\_from\_prior\_fog" field in biomes\_client.json was ignored on first content on resource pack stack ([MCPE-187805](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187805))

## Gameplay

-   Fixed a bug where opening a chest while the clone command is spamming could crash the server

## Graphical

-   Single-channel textures in resource packs are now interpreted as grayscale, rather than red. This change does not apply to single-channel UI textures, which were already interpreted as such

## Graphics

-   client\_biome JSON files now support a "surface\_opacity" field in the "minecraft:water\_appearance" component  
    -   This change also restores swampland and warm\_ocean surface opacity to what they were until recently when the client\_biome JSON files were introduced

## Items

-   Fixed an issue where non-host clients joining multiplayer sessions would be missing an icon for packs that had duplicate items
-   The following legacy item (pre 1.16.100) components are now synced to the client:
    -   `minecraft:camera`
    -   `minecraft:seed`
    -   `minecraft:max_damage`
    -   `minecraft:hand_equipped`
    -   `minecraft:stacked_by_data`
    -   `minecraft:foil`
    -   `minecraft:block`
    -   `minecraft:use_duration`
    -   `minecraft:max_stack_size`
