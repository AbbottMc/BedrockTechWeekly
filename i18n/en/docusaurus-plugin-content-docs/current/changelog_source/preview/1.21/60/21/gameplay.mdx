## Gameplay

    -   We'd love to know what you think of this addition, please send us your feedback at [aka.ms/mcbedrockpausefeedback](https://aka.ms/mcbedrockpausefeedback)

## General

-   The world spawn point algorithm has been improved, so that locations with good biomes but far from the world's origin are preferred over really bad locations but closer to the origin ([MCPE-120237](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-120237))
-   Filter Profanity Toggle. We are introducing a new "Filter Profanity" setting on Windows. When on, all text content including chat will perform as it always has; profanities will be filtered for you and others. When off, most profanities, with the exception of some potentially harmful content, will be unfiltered for you and all others who also have the toggle off. The setting is default on for all players and cannot be changed for child accounts or players not signed in. You can toggle it off in Settings under "General". 

## Mobs

-   Creakings now crumble if their Creaking Heart is forcibly deactivated through commands

-   Fixed an issue where users could sometimes not rejoin a Realm they left by using an invite code. 
-   Removed unnecessary duplicate calls to the Realms API.
