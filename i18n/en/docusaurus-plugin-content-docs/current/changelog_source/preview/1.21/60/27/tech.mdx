## **Script API**

<Switcher techSapi={<TechSapiExp/>} techSapiDiff={undefined}/>

## Experimental

-   Focus Target Camera has vertical\_rotation\_limits of \[0.0, 180.0\] by default to reflect world space changes
    
-   Focus Target camera now stops targeting when either `clear` from the camera command is used, or when the target is over 64 chunks away from the camera
    

## Stability and Performance

-   Experimental support for applying a service-driven texture memory budget in low memory situations. When enabled, memory will be conserved by progressively reducing resolution of some textures as usage approaches the budgeted limit.
