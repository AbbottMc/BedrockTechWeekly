## Entity Components

-   Added the 'minecraft:ignore\_cannot\_be\_attacked' component and moved the filter from 'minecraft:cannot\_be\_attacked' to it. This allows content to have custom mobs which bypass the 'cannot\_be\_attacked' component (for example the one on the Ghast) without requiring a modification of the attacked mob's settings.
