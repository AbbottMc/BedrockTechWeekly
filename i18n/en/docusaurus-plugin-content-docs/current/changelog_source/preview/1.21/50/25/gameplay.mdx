![A Pale Garden with resin block types placed near a crafting table and furnace. There are eyeblossom flowers, and there is a Creaking with particles going to and from a pale oak with a Creaking heart.](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/31291909576205)

Oh good! You found me! I’ve been wandering around the pale garden ever since the last preview and beta update – and let me tell you – the creaking isn’t the _best_ roommate. Luckily this week two new features are coming to the pale garden: resin, and eyeblossoms! Resin is a new block that you can craft after an encounter with the creaking (try asking it to wash its dishes…) and eyeblossoms are a flower unique to the pale garden, that bloom at night. They even bloom with a bit of an orange glow, so perhaps they’ll help me find my way out! As always, we’re keen to get your feedback on these new features at [aka.ms/mcgamedropfeedback](http://aka.ms/mcgamedropfeedback) , and you can report any bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](http://bugs.mojang.com/) ! Here’s what else is new this week:
