# Features and Bug Fixes

## Winter Drop Features

### Pale Garden

    -   Pale Moss patches now have less Tall Grass growing on them
-   Increased Pale Oak density to match Java edition

-   Pale Oak Saplings now grow into Pale Oaks with Hanging Pale Moss on them, but no Pale Moss patch at their base
    
-   The Pale Oak Sign UI no longer has a missing pixel in the upper left corner ([MCPE-187304](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187304))
    
-   The textures of the Pale Oak Sign and Pale Oak Hanging Sign items have been adjusted for consistency with other items in the woodset ([MCPE-187294](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187294))

### Creaking Heart

-   Creaking Heart data is no longer retained when ctrl-picking the block in Creative Mode
    
-   Creaking Heart is now immovable by Pistons

## Accessibility

-   Fixed an issue with Haptic feedback on iOS ([MCPE-145524](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-145524))

## Blocks & Items

\> **Developer's Note**: We've fixed several issues where the tool used to mine some blocks didn't affect the drop or mining speed correctly. Related to these changes, any block that drops when its support is broken will also drop when mined with any tool.

-   The following blocks now only drop when broken with a pickaxe: Blast Furnace, Cauldron, Dispenser, Dropper, Enchanting Table, Furnace, Hopper, and Smoker ([MCPE-33950](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-33950))
    
-   The following blocks that require support now always drop when broken with any tool: all Copper Doors, Iron Door, Heavy Weighted Pressure Plate, Light Weighted Pressure Plate, Polished Blackstone Pressure Plate, and Stone Pressure Plate
    
-   Budding Amethyst is now slower to mine with an improper tool
    
-   The following blocks (which always drop) are now mined faster when using the incorrect tool: Bell, Brewing Stand, Crafter, Ender Chest, Lantern, and Soul Lantern. Note that the Ender Chest is considered an 'always drops block' even though the drop is not an Ender Chest ([MCPE-176374](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-176374))
    

## Gameplay

-   The kill command or any damage greater or equal to the target's current life will now kill it in base game versions below 1.18.20
    
-   Zombified Piglins spawned by Nether Portals now have a 15-second cooldown before they can use the Portal again
    

## Graphical

-   Textures with multiple variations will now load PBR texture data ([MCPE-174191](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-174191))

## Items

-   Updated Heavy Core's item texture 

## Realms

-   Added a loading modal when changing active realms slots to prevent a glitch where multiple Realms Slot Settings Screen are pushed to the stack because of player's button mashing the Edit World button
    
-   Fixed issue where game mode and difficulty were not being preserved after uploading or replacing world in Realms Slot.
    

### Realm Events

-   Added a new Realm Event related to mobs.

## Sounds

-   Adjusted volume & pitch for break, hit, place, fall, step & land sounds for the Amethyst Block

## User Interface
