    -   Named sounds must be defined in "individual\_named\_sounds" in sounds.json files

## Biomes

-   Client biome JSON files now support a "minecraft:biome\_music" component with a "volume\_multiplier" field which will gradually affect music volume when the audio listener is inside the corresponding biome

## Stability and Performance

-   Some stats for packs discovered on launch are stored locally to enable faster future launches on some platforms




<h2 className="experimental_divider">Experimental Features</h2>




## Blocks

-   Added "minecraft:item\_visual" block component. This component takes nested "minecraft:geometry" and "minecraft:material\_instances" components to configure the item representation of a block
    -   "geometry" and "material\_instances" fields are required. They utilize the same fields/requirements as "minecraft:geometry" and "minecraft:material\_instances" respectively
    -   Block must include "minecraft:geometry" and "minecraft:material\_instances" components alongside the "minecraft:item\_visual" component
    -   Requires the "Upcoming Creator Features" toggle
-   Cobwebs now obey 'blockshape' and 'textures' properties set in blocks.json
    -   Requires the "Upcoming Creator Features" toggle


## **Script API**

<Switcher techSapi={<TechSapiExp/>} techSapiDiff={undefined}/>

## Camera

-   Added the rotation to the camera command for the fixed\_boom camera

## Component

-   Added the "minecraft:compostable" item component to UpcomingCreatorFeatures experimental toggle

## Scripting

### Server UI

-   Added support for input glyph replacement for server forms (`ActionFormData`, `MessageFormData`, and `ModalFormData`).

## Structures

-   Expose "Data-Driven Jigsaw Structures" experiment toggle to Creators
    -   Creators will be able to modify structure generation rules around placement (location and frequency), layout (how structure pieces are placed relative to one another), and customization (how blocks within a structure piece are modified or replaced).
    -   There are 4 new JSON files comprising Jigsaw Structure data:
        -   Jigsaw Structures: These are structures that can be constructed throughout the world with various structure pieces. The connection block is a jigsaw block.
        -   Processors: A processor can add custom behaviors to the structure that affects how it looks.
        -   Structure Sets: Structure sets are JSON that indicate where and how a structure is placed throughout the world.
        -   Template Pools: A template pool contains the structure pieces that make up a structure.
