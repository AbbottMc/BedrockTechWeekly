It's time for a new Preview and Beta! This week we're amping up the atmosphere in the pale garden. Eyeblossoms will now puff out orange particles when they open – and leaves will fall from the pale oak trees in the pale garden – adding to the ambiance of this new, eerie biome. As always, we’re keen to get your feedback on these new features at [feedback.minecraft.net](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us) and you can report any bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](http://bugs.mojang.com/)! Here's what's new this week:

    -   They now burn more quickly but take longer to catch on fire
    -   They can now be ignited by Lava
-   The attenuation drop-off rate for Pale Hanging Moss and Creaking Heart ambient sounds is now linear, allowing them to be heard from greater distances ([MCPE-187326](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187326))
-   Eyeblossoms now play sounds when opening and closing
-   Open Eyeblossoms now emit ambient sounds when placed on a Pale Moss Block
-   Vine, Cave Vines, Twisting Vines, and Weeping Vines now play their correct sounds instead of the Nether Wart sound
-   Hanging Pale Moss now has the same model as Java ([MCPE-187397](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187397))
-   Eyeblossoms placed in world and in Flower Pots now emit a particle when opening/closing
-   Pale Oak Leaves now emit falling leaf particles

### Creaking Heart

-   Reduced the distance by which the Creaking Heart can spread Resin Clumps by one block
-   Resin Clumps can now only spread onto Pale Oak Log, Stripped Pale Oak Log, Pale Oak Wood, and Stripped Pale Oak Wood

### Resin Bricks

-   Recipes for Resin Brick Slabs, Stairs, and Walls now give the same amount of blocks as the Nether Brick ones ([MCPE-187707](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187707), [MCPE-187795](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187795), [MCPE-187796](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187796))

\> **Developer's Note:** _Counting is hard._

### Resin Clump

-   Mobs now correctly pathfind over Resin Clumps ([MCPE-187778](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187778))

## Commands

-   Translated rawtexts with extra percentage signs in them no longer expand inconsistently for numbered forms ("%%%%1"), compared to non-numbered ones ("%%%%s"). ([MCPE-171001](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-171001))
-   Effect command now properly displays duration as seconds in the displayed message after adding an effect ([MCPE-186963](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-186963))

## Features

-   Standardized the blocks that trees can replace when growing, with a few exceptions ([MCPE-187302](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187302)) ([MCPE-187301](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187301))
    -   All trees can now grow through leaves, with the exception of Cherry trees cannot grow through their own leaves ([MCPE-168029](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-168029))
    -   All trees can grow on dirt-like blocks ([MCPE-187739](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187739))

-   Tall Grass generates properly with its top part in the Lush Caves biome ([MCPE-125799](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-125799))

## Gameplay

-   Holding the jump button when falling on a Slime Block no longer cancels the bounce ([MCPE-185354](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-185354))
-   Sneaking while landing on a Slime Block no longer causes fall damage

\> **Developer's Note:** The intended way to stop bouncing on a Slime Block is now to sneak.  
\> Previously players could stop bouncing by holding the jump button, but this was an unintentional oversight that worked since the jump effectively cancelled out the movement from the block.
\> 
\> This caused other types of bugs such as when hitting a mob with a Mace with Wind Charge enchantment while holding the jump button.  
\> The new player jump behaviour is to always pick the highest between existing vertical velocity and jump velocity.

-   Fixed one case where blocks would fail to place if a player would place a block and then change their selected slot before the server handled the block placement. This would reject the block placement because the server didn't expect the slot to change ([MCPE-112420](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-112420))

## Graphics

-   Sky color now gradually transitions when traveling between different biomes, rather than changing abruptly ([MCPE-90625](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-90625))

## Items

-   Open and Closed Eyeblossoms can now be used on Mooshrooms to obtain their respective Suspicious Stews when milking ([MCPE-187754](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187754))
-   Blackstone can now be used to repair stone tools and stone weapons ([MCPE-71859](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-71859))

## Mobs

### Creaking

-   Tamed Wolves' attacks no longer prevent Creakings from attacking the Player

-   The Creaking now sways when hit by a projectile
-   The Creaking's attack animation has been smoothed out for a more natural motion
-   The volume and pitch of the Creaking's step sounds have been adjusted
