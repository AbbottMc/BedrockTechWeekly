![The Pale Garden, with a Creaking mob camouflaged in front of a Pale Oak tree, its eyes just visible](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/30892996563213)

Get ready for a particularly eerie preview this week – because foxes can now pick up bundles! No wait, that's not right. I mean – because the pale garden is coming to Bedrock preview! The pale garden is a new biome that might feel serene during the day, but just wait until night falls. Dense with pale oak trees (which bring a new pale oak woodset), and covered in pale moss and pale hanging moss – it might _feel_ like you're all alone, but are you? Peer a little closer in the darkness and you might find a creaking peering back! There's a secret to defeating this new hostile mob though – and you'll have to find a creaking heart block to discover it. As always, we're keen to get your feedback on these new features at [aka.ms/mcgamedropfeedback](https://aka.ms/mcgamedropfeedback), and you can report any bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/)!

# Winter Drop

-   Added Pale Garden Biome, Pale Oak tree, Pale Moss block, Pale Moss carpet, Pale Hanging Moss and Pale Oak wood set
-   Added Creaking mob, Creaking Spawn Egg and Creaking Heart block

### Creaking Heart

A Creaking Heart is a "living" block generating in Pale Oak trees, covered on all sides by Pale Oak wood logs. It can spawn a Creaking mob when it is night time, and it is placed between two correctly aligned Pale Oak log blocks.

-   Is active during night and dormant during day
-   Sends a trail of particles towards the connected Creaking when the Creaking gets hit by the player
-   When Creaking Heart block is destroyed, the connected Creaking is removed

### Creaking Mob

The Creaking mob spawns at night in the Pale Garden biome if there is a Creaking Heart block that has been generated in a Pale Oak tree. Gameplay features:

-   An activated Creaking will not move if a player is looking at it
-   Creaking is invulnerable to damage
-   When hit, a particle trail is shown between the Creaking and the Creaking Heart block it is connected to
-   When the Creaking Heart block the Creaking is connected to is destroyed, the Creaking is removed
-   Is not affected by light levels but spawns and despawns based on day/night cycle
-   Creaking cannot enter Boats
-   Creaking spawned from a Creaking Heart can not go through portals
-   The Creaking Spawn Egg will spawn a Creaking mob that is not connected to a Creaking Heart. The Creaking mob will persist through day and night, loads and saves, and will take damage from attacks and other damage sources. It has one point of health (half a heart)
-   Creaking summoned from the Creaking Heart cannot be spawned with a spawn egg, nor can it be summoned with commands. It can only exist as a part of the Creaking Heart block
-   Player wearing a carved pumpkin on their head can look at Creaking without it freezing in place

### New system for Pale Garden ambient sounds

Ambient sounds in the Pale Garden biome do not come from the biome settings but are generated by blocks found in the biome

-   Pale Hanging Moss emits subtle atmospheric sounds when it is attached to Pale Oak Logs and Pale Oak Leaves
-   Creaking Heart block emits a set of eerie sounds when it is active during night and surrounded by Logs on all sides

Pale Moss block generates naturally in the Pale Garden biome

### Pale Moss Carpet

Pale Moss block generates naturally in the Pale Garden biome. Unique features:

-   When placed, Pale Moss Carpet grows up to two blocks on the solid faces of any block that borders it
-   Pale Moss Carpet can be bone-mealed to grow to full on all solid faces of any block that borders it

### Pale Oak Tree
