## **Script API**

<Switcher techSapi={<TechSapiStable/>} techSapiDiff={undefined}/>

## **GameTest Framework (Experimental)**

_**There has been a major breaking change to experimental JavaScript APIs:**_

All script modules have been renamed to follow a new convention.

-   _mojang-gametest_\-\> _@minecraft/server-gametest_ 
-   _mojang-minecraft_\-\> _@minecraft/server_
-   _mojang-minecraft-ui_\-\> _@minecraft/server-ui_
-   _mojang-minecraft-server-admin_\-\> _@minecraft/server-admin_
-   _mojang-net_\-\> _@minecraft/server-net_

For example, rather than using:

```js
import * as mc from "mojang-minecraft";
```

Use

```js
import * as mc from "@minecraft/server";
```


Use of script eval() and Function() must be explicitly enabled in  manifest.json 

To do this, set script\_eval in capabilities array.

"capabilities": \[  "script\_eval"\]

-   Root path for imports has changed; scripts/ prefix are no longer allowed.
-   For imports, use import "./source.js" or import "source.js"
-   Deprecated use of import "scripts/source.js"
