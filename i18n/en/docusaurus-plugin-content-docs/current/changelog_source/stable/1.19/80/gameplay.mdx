# **Experimental Features:**

Even more experimental features are available in this update that are coming in the [**Trails & Tales**](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/the-trails---tales-update) update!

As these features are still incomplete, in development, and considered a work in progress, be sure to backup your worlds before enabling experimental features. The features can be enabled by turning on the “Next Major Update” toggle in world settings.  
  

## **Player Sneaking**

-   The ability to sneak under 1.5 block gaps is now behind the “Short Sneak” toggle. Enable the toggle to continue to test out the feature while we continue polishing it
-   Player’s hitbox height now reduces to 1.5 blocks while sneaking
    -   Sneaking will automatically be initiated while stuck in a gap of less than 1.8 blocks
    -   Sneaking will lower the player camera height respective of these changes
    -   Sneaking now requires enough space to stand in order to exit sneaking state
    -   Players will transition from swimming to sneaking if they are unable to stand up but would be able to sneak

## **Cherry Grove**

-   Introducing the Cherry Grove biome, with pretty Cherry Blossom trees. You can find it in the mountains, like Meadows
-   It has a new flower, Pink Petals, as ground cover, which can be crafted into Pink Dye
-   Pigs, Rabbits, Sheep, and Bees spawn there
-   Comes with a new wood set for the Cherry Blossom trees

## **Archaeology**

-   Added the Trail Ruins, a buried structure from a lost culture
-   Added Suspicious Gravel block, which has the same characteristics as Suspicious Sand
-   Added Suspicious Sand to Warm Ocean Ruins
-   Added Suspicious Gravel to Cold Ocean Ruins
-   Added 16 new Pottery Shards (Now 20 Pottery Shards in total)
    -   These have been distributed between the five Archaeology sites: Desert Wells, Desert Temples, Cold Ocean Ruins, Warm Ocean Ruins, and Trail Ruins

## **Armor Trims**

-   You can now visually customize your armor with a variety of unique trims at the Smithing Table
-   Armor Trims are purely visual with no gameplay benefits, and can only be applied to Helmets, Chestplates, Leggings, and Boots
    -   All trim patterns are visually the same on an armor's item icon, but the color will still change based on the trim material
    -   To check which trim pattern a piece of armor has, you can hover over it in the inventory
-   An Armor Trim has two properties: a pattern and a material
    -   The pattern is defined by the Smithing Template used to apply the trim, and represents the visual pattern of the trim
    -   The material is defined by what ingredient you used to apply the trim, and represents the color of the trim
-   The viable ingredients you can use to define the color of your Armor Trim are the following:
    -   Iron
    -   Copper
    -   Gold
    -   Lapis
    -   Emerald
    -   Diamond
    -   Netherite
    -   Redstone
    -   Amethyst
    -   Quartz

## **Smithing Templates**

-   Smithing Tables have been redesigned into a workstation for physical equipment upgrades and modifications
-   Alongside slots for combining a piece of equipment and materials, there is now a required slot for an item type called Smithing Templates
-   Smithing Templates define what type of upgrade you will be making to equipment
    -   It specifies both what type of items you can upgrade, and which ingredients are valid to customize the upgrade
    -   There are currently two categories of Smithing Templates: Armor Trim and Netherite Upgrade
-   Armor Trim Smithing Templates can be found all throughout the world, and each of the following structures contain their own unique Smithing Template:
    -   Pillager Outpost: Sentry Armor Trim
    -   Desert Pyramid: Dune Armor Trim
    -   Shipwreck: Coast Armor Trim
    -   Jungle Temple: Wild Armor Trim
    -   Ocean Monument: Tide Armor Trim
    -   Ancient City: Ward Armor Trim
    -   Woodland Mansion: Vex Armor Trim
    -   Nether Fortress: Rib Armor Trim
    -   Bastion Remnant: Snout Armor Trim
    -   Stronghold: Eye Armor Trim
    -   End City: Spire Armor Trim
    -   Trail Ruins: Wayfinder Armor Trim, Raiser Armor Trim, Shaper Armor Trim, Host Armor Trim
    -   Ancient City: Silence Armor Trim
-   Smithing Templates are found in Chests in their respective structure, except for the Ocean Monument. Instead of finding it in Chests, Elder Guardians sometimes drop a Smithing Template when defeated
-   Some Armor Trim Smithing Templates are rarer than others, so be on the lookout for them to impress your friends!
-   Smithing Templates are consumed when used to upgrade an item in the Smithing Table
-   You can craft a copy of a Smithing Template in the Crafting Table with 7 Diamonds + 1 block of material that the template is made out of + 1 Smithing Template, which will output 2 of the same Smithing Template

## **Netherite Equipment**

-   Netherite equipment crafting now also requires a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template
-   Netherite Upgrade Smithing Templates can be found randomly in all Bastion Remnant chests, and there is a guarantee of 2 in every Treasure Room Bastion Remnant
-   This change was made for a variety of reasons:
    -   Increases the time players utilize Diamond equipment before Netherite
    -   Make Netherite equipment a more significant achievement in the game's progression
    -   Adapts Netherite more naturally into the new Smithing Table crafting system

## **Calibrated Sculk Sensors**

-   A new variant of Sculk Sensors which allows you to filter vibrations based on their frequency level. They are not found naturally and can only be crafted
-   They can be crafted with 1 Sculk Sensor and 3 Amethyst Shards in the Crafting Table
-   One side of the Calibrated Sculk Sensor can receive a Redstone signal as input
    -   The strength of that Redstone signal is the only vibration frequency the Sculk Sensor will listen to

## **Vibration Resonance**

-   Blocks of Amethyst have a new behavior when placed adjacent to Sculk Sensors
-   If that Sculk Sensor receives a vibration, the Block of Amethyst will re-emit its frequency as a separate vibration at its location
-   This behaviour is called Vibration Resonance, and allows players to move vibration frequencies across long distances without having to recreate the vibration naturally

## **Sign Improvements**

-   Signs have improved customization options
-   Sign text can now be edited after being placed in the world
    -   This can be done by interacting with the Sign
-   Both sides of the Sign can now have separate text and colors, allowing for further customization options
    -   By default, a Sign will prompt you to input the front side's text when placed
    -   To apply text to the back-side, you must walk to the other side and interact with that face to edit it
-   Signs can now also be waxed with Honeycomb, preventing any further edits to its text
