## **Updated Add-On Template Packs**

-   Updated Add-On templates for 19.80 with new resources, behaviors, and documentation are available to download at [aka.ms/MCAddonPacks  
    ](https://aka.ms/MCAddOnPacks)

## **General**

-   For behavior packs using version 1.19.80 and above, recipes no longer accept a Molang query for the item's data field, instead use the item's full name, eg. use \{ "item": "namespace:actor\_spawn\_egg" \} instead of \{ "item": "spawn\_egg", "data": "query.get\_actor\_info\_id('namespace:actor')" \}
-   Fixed an issue that caused the InteractComponent to not work correctly while sneaking ([MCPE-168449](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-168449))

## **Commands**

-   The /execute command now displays an appropriate error message when there is an error in the second or subsequent subcommand target selector ([MCPE-164304](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-164304))
-   Provide auto-complete support for block states
-   Added two new overloads to the summon command:
    -   /summon \[spawnPos : x y z\] facing \<position: x y z\> \[spawnEvent: string\] \[nametag: string\]
    -   /summon \[spawnPos : x y z\] facing \<lookAtEntity: target\> \[spawnEvent: string\] \[nametag: string\]
-   Fixed an issue where the paste button in the Command Block UI would remember extra presses from failed pastes ([MCPE-163705](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-163705))
-   For worlds using game version 1.19.80 and above, acquiring a custom spawn egg through a command can only succeed with their full name rather than with an aux value, eg. "/give @s namespace:actor\_spawn\_egg"
-   "fence" block is now split into unique names, "oak\_fence", "acacia\_fence", "birch\_fence", "dark\_oak\_fence", "jungle\_fence", and "spruce\_fence"
-   Commands will still work with "fence", but only new fence name will be suggested in the command prompt
-   Removed requirement for blockState argument(s) when using other optional args in /fill /setblock and /clone ([MCPE-167959](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-167959))
-   Implemented the "inputpermission" command, which allows for setting the player's camera or movement as enabled or disabled
    -   Syntax: /inputpermission set \<target: player\> \<permission: camera | movement\> \<state: enabled | disabled\>
-   Implemented the "haspermission" target selector, which allows for selection based on player permission levels

## **Game Events**

-   _item\_interact\_finish_ game event now has a vibration frequency of 2 instead of 14
-   _item\_interact\_start_ is no longer considered a detectable vibration
-   Reeling a fishing rod now emits _projectile\_shoot_ vibration

## **Data-Driven Components**

-   Added "lose\_target" field to projectile data to specify if an entity should unselect its target after shooting the projectile
-   Added a new Transformation component for blocks to support rotation, scaling and translation. The component can be added to the whole block, and/or to individual block permutations. Eg.

"minecraft:transformation": \{  
                "translation": \[0.0, 0.1, -0.1\],  
                "scale": \[0.5, 1, 1.5\],  
      "rotation": \[90, 180, 0\]  
\}

-   Transformed geometries still have the same restrictions that non-transformed geometries have, eg. a maximum size of 30/16 units

## **Add-Ons and Script Engine**

-   Chance information types used in tree feature JSONs for some trunks and foliage now allow 0 as the chance (values like 0.0001 were allowed, but not 0)
-   Form promises are now rejected using typed errors, vs. strings as used previously

## **Entity Filters**

-   Created new entity filter "is\_raider" to determine if subject is part of a raid

## **AI Goals**

-   Added "cooldown" field to target descriptors in "minecraft:behavior.nearest\_attackable\_target" goal

## **Blocks**

-   Deprecated _minecraft:part\_visibility_ block component
-   Added _bone\_visibility_ behavior to _minecraft:geometry_ block component

## **ItemStack**

-   Added function _getTags(): string\[\]_ - Returns all tags for the item
-   Added function _hasTag(tag: string): boolean_ - Returns true if the item has the specified tag

## **EntityEquipmentInventoryComponent**

-   This component is used to manipulate the equipment of mobs and players. To use it, call _getComponent('equipment\_inventory')_
-   Added function _getEquipment(equipmentSlot: EquipmentSlot): ItemStack | undefined_ _-_ Returns the item in the given equipment slot
-   Added function _getEquipmentSlot(equipmentSlot: EquipmentSlot): ContainerSlot_ - Returns the container slot for the given equipment slot
-   Added function _setEquipment(equipmentSlot: EquipmentSlot, itemStack?: ItemStack): void_ - Sets the item in the given equipment slot

-   The ItemDurabilityComponent now works with all damageable items, not just custom items
-   Removed property _damageRange_
-   Setting damage will now throw an exception if it is outside of the range \[0, maxDurability\]

## **Marketplace**

-   In the map WDW Magic Kingdom, the carts on the Big Thunder Mountain, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, and Space Mountain rides now properly align with the invisible Minecart they are attached to

## **Servers**

-   Blocks can now optionally (via a setting in StartGamePacket) use a hashed value for their network IDs. This hashed value is independent of all other blocks and remains stable across future releases

## **GameTest Framework**

-   Updated specific GameTest exceptions to be thrown as GameTestError error objects
-   Added two new commands:
    -   /gametest stopall - Used to manually stop all tests while they are running
    -   /gametest runsetuntilfail - Used to run a set of tests but will automatically stop if any of the tests fail
