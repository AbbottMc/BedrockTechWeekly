## **Animation**

-   Fixed an issue where animation events, sound effect events, and particle events would not trigger if the event time specified was equal to the total "animation\_length"

    -   Previously nested conditional expressions like 'A?B:C?D:E'would evaluate as ' (A?B:C)?D:E', now they evaluate as 'A?B:(C?D:E'
-   Access of missing public variables on other entities will return 0.0 and not cause an error
-   Fix loading of public variables containing capital letters to not cause an error
-   Added "slot.equippable" added as a slot option for WearableItemComponent and Molang
-   Added alland query.any to check if a value matches all or any of the following values
-   Added in\_rangeto check if a value is in the (inclusive) range between a min and max value

## **Block Components (Experimental)**

-   Fixed BlockPartVisibilityComponent for multiplayer by adding network save/load tags ([MCPE-141908](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-141908))

## **GameTest Framework (Experimental)**

There are some important breaking changes in APIs creators should be aware of:

-   Renamed mojang-minecraft:Worldobject to mojang-minecraft:world 
    -   In practice, this means “World.getDimension” code should now read “world.getDimension”
-   Removed mojang-minecraft:Commands- Instead, we are adding runCommand methods on dimension, entity, and player
    -   In practice, this means that “Commands.run(“say Hello World”, dimension)” should now read “dimension.runCommand(“say Hello World”)”

## **mojang-minecraft module**
