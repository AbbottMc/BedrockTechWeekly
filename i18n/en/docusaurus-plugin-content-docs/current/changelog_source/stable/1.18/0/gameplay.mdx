## **New Features:**

## **Increased World Height and Depth**

-   Overworld height and depth for new and existing worlds has been extended to y320 and y-64, opening up more space to explore and build in

## **World Blending**

-   Players can now update existing worlds to include the new overworld height dimensions and world generation features. See our [World Upgrading FAQ](https://aka.ms/ccworldupgrade) for more details
-   The bedrock layer at y0 below saved chunks will be replaced with Deepslate and feature new cave generation underneath
-   Biomes and terrain generating across new and existing chunk borders will blend seamlessly, creating natural-looking environmental transitions

## **New Terrain and Mountain Generation**

-   Terrain shape and elevation is no longer always determined by biome, resulting in new biome placements such as deserts on top of hills
-   Mountains are taller than ever and can now generate up to a maximum height of 256 blocks

## **New Biomes, 3D Biome Generation, and Biome Distribution**

-   Added 3D biomes - cave biomes can now generate directly below surface biomes
-   New cave and mountain biomes added, including Jagged Peaks, Meadows, Lush Caves and Dripstone Caves

## **New Cave Generation**

-   Added noise caves - the three primary types of noise caves are large, open Cheese Caves, wide, tunnelling Spaghetti Caves and the narrow, winding Noodle Caves
-   Added aquifers - these create local level bodies of water such as flooded caves or underground lakes

## **Ore Distribution and Large Ore Veins**

-   Added large ore veins - these long formations stretch through cave systems and contain larger deposits of ore than the clusters usually found underground

## **New Achievements/Trophies**

## **"Old" World Type**

-   Removed "Old" world type from the world creation screen
-   Locked Old worlds to BaseGameVersion 1.17.40
-   Existing Old worlds are still playable but will not be updated with 1.18 features

## **Menu Panorama**

-   Added a new main menu panorama showing the beautiful cliffs of the Overworld

## **Android External Storage**

-   Players with external storage will be migrated to new location at start up, due to storage changes required by Google. You can still play if migration fails by closing the results window
-   With external storage being migrated to its new location in preparation for Google's new API requirements, you will now lose your data if you uninstall Minecraft, unless you check the box indicating you want to keep your data. We recommend checking this box if you wish to keep your worlds in the event you choose to reinstall Minecraft
-   For more information on storage changes, please see the [FAQ article](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4411299967629)

## **Known Issues:**

-   New world generation in this release is currently incompatible with the 'Creation of Custom Biomes' experimental toggle. Expect worlds with custom biome generation to be potentially unstable and for custom biomes to only exist in currently saved out areas of the world.
-   World generation for the Minecraft Overworld has changed entirely with this release. This means old seeds will no longer spawn players in the same positions when playing 1.18. If creators are version locked to an old version of the game, their seeds will generate worlds as they were prior to 1.18.
