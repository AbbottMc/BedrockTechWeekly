## **Updated Add-On Template Packs**

-   Updated Add-On templates for 1.18.0 with new resources, behaviors, and documentation, are available to download at [aka.ms/MCAddOnPacks](https://aka.ms/MCAddOnPacks)

## **Fixes**

-   Players are disconnected if server and client have different Runtime Block IDs
-   Fixed a rendering error that could occur when attempting to render a Vanilla mob in a base game version prior to the version that mob was introduced through JSON files
-   Most content errors and warnings will now only display once per world ([MCPE-135153](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-135153))
-   Improved performance in 'RangedAttackGoal' for mobs that do not move
-   Fixed mobs' default summonability when not specified in JSON
-   Fixed a versioning error with animation controllers that was causing the wrong schema to be utilized on Marketplace worlds with an animation controller version 1.8.0

## **Commands**

-   The '/clone' command has been updated to properly check for overlapping source and destinations areas no longer allowing for a 1 block depth overlap on each axis. This can continue to be overridden via the force clone option

## **GameTest Framework

-   New Item API updates: ItemStack
    -   Exposed interfaces for accessing script-enabled ItemComponents on ItemStack. Note that these item components only work in conjunction with custom items defined via the Holiday Creator Features experiment
    -   hasComponent(componentId: string) - returns true if the ItemStack has the component \[componentId\] attached to it
    -   getComponent(componentId: string) - returns a handle to the component attached to this ItemStack. Returns an undefined handle if the component does not exist or if the component is yet to be exposed to script
    -   getComponents() - returns an array of all attached script-enabled components on this ItemStack
-   Script Enabled Item Components
