## **Fixes:**

-   Fixed several crashes on Nintendo Switch that could occur during gameplay, especially surrounding villager job site blocks
-   Fixed issues with Marketplace maps so 'villager\_v2' works in command selectors again, targeting both V1 and V2 villagers
-   Fixed the screen flashing white after relaunching the game on Oculus Rift

Nintendo Switch players also receive the following fixes from version 1.11.3:

-   Another fix for villagers changing their professions when they're not supposed to
-   Fixed pathfinding so when an entity can't float, swim, or be amphibious, it can still walk at the bottom of water
-   Fixed gamertags and gamerpics of Realms members not appearing on the members list
-   The Realms members list no longer returns to the first page when navigating to another page
