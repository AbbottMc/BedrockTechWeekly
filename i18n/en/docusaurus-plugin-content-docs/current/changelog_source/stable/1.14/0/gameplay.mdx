## **New Features:**

-   **PlayStation®4**
    -   Welcome PlayStation®4 players to the Bedrock version of Minecraft! All Bedrock platforms can now cross-play with PS4™ consoles. More information can be found in the [Minecraft for PlayStation®4 FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360037725571-Minecraft-for-PlayStation-TM-4-FAQ).

-   **Bees!**
    -   Bees are cute, fuzzy, neutral mobs
    -   Don’t hurt them, they don’t want to hurt you
    -   Bees love pretty flowers and spend their lives gathering pollen from them
    -   After gathering pollen, bees fly back to their nest
    -   If a bee can't find pollen, it will return home
    -   If a bee doesn’t have a home nest, it will wander around until it finds one it can use
    -   Bees don’t like the rain and they sleep at night. They will return to their nest in these cases

-   **Bee Nests and Beehives**
    -   Bee Nests generate in Flower Forests, Plains, and Sunflower Plains biomes
    -   When a bee visits a nest and completes its journey undisturbed, the level of honey increases
    -   Using shears on a full hive or nest will harvest Honeycomb and using a glass bottle will give a Honey Bottle
    -   Campfire smoke calms bees - Place one underneath the nest or hive to keep them in chill mode
    -   Redstone friendly! Dispensers can shear honeycombs from hives and nests

-   **Honey Block**
    -   Greatly reduces movement speed and jump height, but also reduces fall damage
    -   You can “slide” down a wall of honey blocks to slow your fall (Parkour FTW!)
    -   When a honey block is piston-moved, adjacent blocks also move
    -   When a honey block is piston-moved, entities on top are moved along with it

-   **Honeycomb Block**
    -   A decorative block that can be crafted with Honeycomb

-   **New Achievements**
    -   Bee our guest - Use a Campfire to collect Honey from a Beehive using a Bottle without aggravating the bees (15G)
    -   Total Beelocation - Move and place a Bee Nest, with 3 bees inside, using Silk Touch (30G)
    -   Sticky Situation - Slide down a honey block to slow your fall (30G)
