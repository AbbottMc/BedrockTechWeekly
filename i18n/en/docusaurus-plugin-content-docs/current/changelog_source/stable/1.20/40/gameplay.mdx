# **Experimental Features**

## **Villager Trade Rebalancing**

This experiment has no effect on normal worlds. If you want to try these changes, you must turn on the Feature Toggle in the Experiments Menu when creating a new world.

Thank you to everyone that has sent in their suggestions and feedback regarding the experimental trade change! We are trying out these changes to rebalance the villager trade system and make it more fair and fun for everyone. However, **these changes are not yet final** and they will stay as experimental features while we continue to work on them. We appreciate your feedback on these changes. Visit [this link](https://aka.ms/VillagerTradingFeedback) to share your thoughts! We have been following the discussions about the previous Librarian and Wandering Trader updates and look forward to seeing the conversation continue.

## **Cartographer**

Before now, Cartographers only sold maps to the Ocean Monument and Woodland Mansion. In this experiment Cartographers can sell seven new maps as well. These new maps each point to a different village or structure and can be used to find seven different biomes. This will help players who want to quickly find a specific location without waiting until they come across it by chance.

Cartographers from different biomes will sell a different selection of maps. Starting from one village, it will be possible to find every other village type by following maps from village to village.

![villager-trades-1.png](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/20640447666829)

Cartographers now sell 7 new maps: Desert Village Map, Jungle Explorer Map, Plains Village Map, Savanna Village Map, Snow Village Map, Swamp Explorer Map, and Taiga Village Map.  
  

## **Armorer**

The Armorer's trades have been updated with many changes.

The biggest change is that buying diamond armor now requires paying a small amount of Diamonds as well as Emeralds. This is meant to make the Armorer's diamond armor trades less useful at the start of the game when players don't have any Diamonds, while still giving a powerful advantage to advanced players who have spent some time collecting Diamonds.

Early-game players will find Armorers useful as a great source of iron armor, Shields, and Emeralds.

Other changes include:

-   Most master-level Armorers buy Iron Blocks (and pay very well for them)
-   Chainmail armor is exclusively sold by the secret Jungle and Swamp Armorers
-   The Savanna Armorer sells cursed diamond armor at reduced prices
-   The Taiga Armorer can swap one piece of diamond armor for another

-   Ancient Cities: Mending
-   Mineshafts: Efficiency (I to V)
-   Pillager Outposts: Quick Charge (I to III)
-   Desert Temples: Unbreaking (I to III)
