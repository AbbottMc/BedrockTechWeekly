## **Updated Add-On Template Packs**

-   Updated Add-On templates for 1.20.40 with new resources, behaviors, and documentation are available to download at [aka.ms/MCAddonPacks](https://aka.ms/MCAddonPacks)

## **Stability and Performance**

-   The Sounds definition file sound\_definitions.json will no longer crash the game if the wrong json type is used for a specific sound definition ([MCPE-168913](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-168913))

## **Commands**

-   Re-entering a world no longer breaks command autocomplete after a command using "@e\[type=item\]" was used ([MCPE-164734](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-164734))
-   The /damage command with the "override" cause now causes damage through post hit invulnerability ([MCPE-160290](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-160290))
-   The recipe command color has been changed to white instead of blue ([MCPE-173362](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-173362))

## **Mobs**

-   Added a new “_query.is\_in\_lava_” Query Function to Molang, to know if a mob is currently in Lava

## **Molang**

-   Molang updated to version 1.20.40 which replaces "block\_property" and "has\_block\_property" with "block\_state" and "has\_block\_state"
    -   This is a Molang Versioned Change that only takes effect for Molang expressions in packs that use a min\_engine\_version of 1.20.40 or higher

## **Trade Tables**

-   Trade items now have a "filters" property to determine if a trade should be considered
-   Trade items no longer support the "biome" property to check villager biome types, the "is\_mark\_variant" filter can be used in the "filters" property instead to check the villager biome type


## **Script API**

## **Blocks**

-   "minecraft:transformation" now prevents blocks from being transformed past the 30x30x30 pixel limit and "minecraft:unit\_cube" from being translated or scaled. Invalid block will instead display the "update" block ([MCPE-173799](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-173799))
-   Chest blocks, Trapped Chest blocks, Ender Chest blocks, and Stonecutter blocks now use state "minecraft:cardinal\_direction" instead of "facing\_direction", this state uses string values \["south", "west", "north", and "east"\] instead of \[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6\]

## **Items**

-   Added a content error when attempting to load a damage sensor with an invalid "cause" value
-   Allow single value parsing for "minecraft:icon" item component
-   The Camel mob Dash Component can now be applied to rideable mobs other than Horse, Donkey, and Mule using “minecraft:dash”
-   Deprecated "minecraft:weapon" component starting in version 1.20.40
-   Deprecated "minecraft:on\_use" component starting in version 1.20.40
-   Deprecated "minecraft:on\_use\_on" component starting in version 1.20.40

## **Entity Components**

-   Unlocked “behavior.random\_search\_and\_dig” for creators to use
-   "target\_blocks" field added. List of blocks that the mob can dig on. Default if "target\_blocks" isn't added is Dirt, Grass, Podzol, Dirt with Roots, Moss, Mud, and Muddy Mangrove Roots
-   "item\_table" field added. Path to a loot table that specifies what the mob can dig up. "item\_table" takes precedence over "items"
-   Content errors added if the behavior has trouble reading or finding "item\_table" and if unable to get an item from "items"
-   'on\_item\_found' event now fires on item found AND digging finished. Before the event firing caused the digging to stop early
-   The “_behavior.random\_look\_around\_and\_sit_” now has the field “_continue\_sitting\_on\_reload_” exposed for Creators to use. This is how the Camel stays sitting on reload
-   “_behavior.is\_scenting_” renamed to generic “_behavior.timer\_flag\_1_” and released to creators
-   “_behavior.is\_rising_” renamed to generic “_behavior.timer\_flag\_2_” and released to creators
-   “_behavior.is\_feeling\_happy_” renamed to generic “_behavior.timer\_flag\_3_” and released to creators
-   “_behavior.timer\_flag 1_”: Fires an event when this behavior starts, then waits for a duration before stopping. When stopping due to that timeout or due to being interrupted by another behavior, fires another event. _query.timer\_flag\_1_ will return 1.0 on both the client and server when this behavior is running, and 0.0 otherwise
-   “_behavior.timer\_flag 2_”: Fires an event when this behavior starts, then waits for a duration before stopping. When stopping due to that timeout or due to being interrupted by another behavior, fires another event. _query.timer\_flag\_2_ will return 1.0 on both the client and server when this behavior is running, and 0.0 otherwise
-   “_behavior.timer\_flag 3_”: Fires an event when this behavior starts, then waits for a duration before stopping. When stopping due to that timeout or due to being interrupted by another behavior, fires another event. _query.timer\_flag\_3_ will return 1.0 on both the client and server when this behavior is running, and 0.0 otherwise
