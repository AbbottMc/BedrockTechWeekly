<Switcher techSapi={<TechSapiStable/>} techSapiDiff={undefined}/>

## **Mobs**

-   Added spawn categories to Bedrock. They will be used in the future for mob spawning. Spawn categories have been enabled in entity behavior pack files, but are not yet functional

## **Blocks**

-   Blocks using custom tags in the “crafting\_tags” field of their custom blocks with a “minecraft:crafting\_table” component now support custom unlockable recipes ([MCPE-175555](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-175555))
    -   This fixed a bug where some recipes did not show up when recipe unlocking was on
-   “sapling” block is now split into unique instances: “oak\_sapling”, “spruce\_sapling”, “birch\_sapling”, “jungle\_sapling”, “acacia\_sapling” and “dark\_oak\_sapling”
-   “coral\_fan” block is now split into unique instances: “tube\_coral\_fan”, “brain\_coral\_fan”, “bubble\_coral\_fan”, “fire\_coral\_fan” and “horn\_coral\_fan”
-   “coral\_fan\_dead” block is now split into unique instances: “dead\_tube\_coral\_fan”, “dead\_brain\_coral\_fan”, “dead\_bubble\_coral\_fan”, “dead\_fire\_coral\_fan” and “dead\_horn\_coral\_fan”
-   “red\_flower” block is now split into unique instances: “poppy”, “blue\_orchid”, “allium”, “azure\_bluet”, “red\_tulip”, “orange\_tulip”, “white\_tulip”, “pink\_tulip”, “oxeye\_daisy”, “cornflower”, and “lily\_of\_the\_valley”

## **Cameras**

-   Added the “extend\_player\_rendering” camera component which allows for players (and any entities they are connected to through riding and leashes) to be rendered even if they are beyond the max entity render distance
-   Added “extend\_player\_rendering” component to the “minecraft:free” camera
    -   This component is intended to be an enhancement and improvement to current functionality and as such will be “_set to true_” by default.
    -   Setting this component to false will remove the added rendering capability.
    -   More information on this and other camera capabilities can be found at [Camera Command Introduction | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/cameracommandintroduction?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable)
-   The server now sends chunks and actors around the camera to the client if that information already exists on the server even when the camera is placed far away from the player

## **Commands**

-   Moved the /hud command out of Upcoming Creator Features experimental toggle.
    -   More on the HUD elements included can be found at [hud Command | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/commands/commands/hud?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable)
-   Updated /titleraw and /tellraw to include support for rendering input key glyphs.

## **Components**

-   The “interact” component’s fields “equip\_item\_slot” and “drop\_item\_slot” now support both armor and inventory slots:
    -   Armor slots are specified as ‘slot.armor.head’, ‘slot.armor.chest’, ‘slot.armor.legs’, and ‘slot.armor.feet’
    -   Inventory slots are specified as positive numbers, now expressed as strings
    -   This change requires a world version of 1.20.80 or higher
-   Added “repair\_entity\_item” field to the “interact” component, which allows to repair an item in one of the entity’s inventory or armor slots
-   Entities running "behavior.follow\_owner" no longer risk getting stuck into each other when teleporting to their owner
-   Added the “minecraft:body\_rotation\_blocked” component, which prevents an entity from visually rotating their body to match their own facing direction
-   The durations and cooldowns of “behavior.timer\_flag\_1,” “behavior.timer\_flag\_2,” and “behavior.timer\_flag\_3” are now correctly randomized on both start and stop, rather than only on spawn

## **Entity Filters**

-   Added new entity filter “is\_sitting”, which checks if the entity is sitting
-   Added new entity filter “has\_damaged\_equipment”, which checks if the entity has a certain damaged piece of equipment in the specified slot 

## **Molang**

-   Added new query “query.armor\_slot\_damage”, which returns the damage value of the armor item in the specified slot

## **Recipes**

-   Added _assume\_symmetry_ boolean property for Shaped Recipes to allow for symmetrical shaped recipes with different outputs.
    -   More on this feature and samples can be found at [Recipe Documentation -Shaped Recipe | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/reference/content/recipereference/examples/recipedefinitions/minecraftrecipe_shaped?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable)
