Your thoughts on the game continue to shape new updates so please upvote and report any new bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com) and leave us your feedback at [feedback.minecraft.net](https://feedback.minecraft.net/).  
  

## **New Features:**

## **Armadillo**

-   The Armadillo is a new passive mob that:
    -   spawns in Savannas and Badlands biomes
    -   drops Armadillo Scutes periodically
    -   drops Armadillo Scutes when brushed
    -   its favorite food is Spider Eyes

## **Armadillo Rolling Up Behavior**

-   Armadillo rolls up when it detects a threat such as:
    -   a sprinting player
    -   a player in a vehicle or mounted
    -   undead mobs
    -   a mob, or a player that has attacked it recently
-   It does not roll up when:
    -   it is fleeing
    -   in water
    -   in the air or
    -   on a leash
-   When an Armadillo is rolled up it does not walk, cannot eat, and will not be tempted by food
    -   It will continue to scan for threats, occasionally peeking to check the surroundings: if none are detected for 4 seconds, it will unroll
    -   In a rolled up state, its shell will protect it, and reduce the damage dealt to it, even allowing it to fully resist weak attacks
    -   Spiders and Cave Spiders will run away from Armadillos, and only if they are not in a rolled up state

## **Armadillo Scutes**

-   Armadillo Scutes can be used to craft Wolf Armor
-   They are dropped by Armadillos
-   Dispensers can be used to brush Armadillo Scutes off Armadillos

## **Wolf Armor**

-   The Wolf Armor will protect the wolf from most damage sources until the armor loses all durability and breaks
-   Wolf Armor shows signs of increased breakage as durability goes down
-   Players can repair the Wolf Armor with Armadillo Scutes while it is equipped on the Wolf, or on an Anvil using Armadillo Scutes
-   Wolf armor can be dyed in similar fashion to Leather Armor
-   Using Wolf Armor on an adult tamed Wolf will equip the armor on the Wolf
-   Only a Wolf's owner can put a Wolf Armor on their tamed Wolf, and with this in mind; Dispensers cannot put Wolf Armor on wolves
-   Using Shears on a Wolf that is wearing armor will make it drop the armor
-   Only a Wolf's owner can repair a Wolf Armor on a Wolf or shear a Wolf Armor from it, and with this in mind; Dispensers cannot remove Wolf Armor from wolves
-   If a Wolf dies while wearing armor, it will drop the armor

## **Tamed Wolves health and damage**

-   Tamed Wolves now have 40 health points (20 hearts) instead of 20 health points (10 hearts)
-   They no longer take half of the damage from most environmental sources like they used to do
    -   In most cases this change will make no difference given the health boost, but now they can withstand more damage from players and arrows
-   Feeding a Wolf now heals twice as many health points
-   Adjusted spawning conditions for Wolves, allowing them to spawn on Coarse Dirt and Podzol blocks

## **Wolf variants**

New Wolf variants have been added. The variant is determined by the biome they spawn in. Read about each one in this [paw-some article](https://www.minecraft.net/article/new-minecraft-wolves)!

-   Pale Wolf - The familiar Wolf variant that now spawns in the Taiga biome, with a default pack size of 4
-   Woods Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Forest biome. This will be the dominant Wolf variant that you will be able to find in the Overworld, since the Forest biome is very common
-   Ashen Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Snowy Taiga biome
-   Black Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Old Growth Pine Taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
-   Chestnut Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Old Growth Spruce Taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
-   Rusty Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves - the Sparse Jungle biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
-   Spotted Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves - the Savanna Plateau biome, in larger packs of 4 to 8
-   Striped Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves, the Wooded Badlands biome, in larger packs of 4 to 8
-   Snowy Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Grove biome. A rare type, that always walks alone

When summoned in other ways (e.g. using the Spawn Egg or using the summon command), the variant selection follows the natural spawning biome rules with the following extensions:

-   Rusty Wolf: will be selected in all Jungle biomes, including Jungle and Bamboo Jungle Biomes
-   Spotted Wolf: will be selected in all Savanna biomes, including Savanna and Windswept Savanna Biomes
-   Striped Wolf: will be selected in all Badlands biomes, including Badlands and Eroded Badlands Biomes

## **Realms Stories**

-   Introducing Realms Stories, a new social hub for your Realm
    -   Realms Stories features include: 
        -   The Story Feed – lets you share your greatest gameplay moments with your fellow Realm members
        -   The Timeline – lets you see when other members are playing on the Realm
        -   The Members tab – shows a list of all Realm members and their permission levels
        -   Realm Events – Stories that get posted automatically when certain player actions are taken in the Realm. There are 19 unique Realm Events so far – can you discover all of them?
-   Known issues:
    -   We need a little more time to deliver the best possible experience for iOS & Android, and will be rolling out Realms Stories on these platforms in the near future.
    -   Xbox-only: If multiple users are signed into an Xbox, then the users might not be able to post to Realms Stories from that Xbox (unless all users besides the primary user log out).
    -   Xbox-only: If multiple users are signed into an Xbox, Realm Events will not be posted, but they will be recorded. If all users but the primary user sign out of Xbox, and the primary user returns to the Minecraft play screen, the Realm Events that were recorded before should get posted. However, the Realm Events may be credited to the wrong user.
    -   If users are in split-screen mode, only the primary user will be able to open Realms Stories.
    -   If users are in with a guest (user who is not signed into their Microsoft account), and the primary user attempts to make a post, the post may fail, or be credited to the wrong user.
