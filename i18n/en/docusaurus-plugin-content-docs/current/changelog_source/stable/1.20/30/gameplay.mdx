# **New Features**

## **Updated “You Died” Experience**

Today we’re making some changes to the screen you see when you die in Minecraft. The camera now zooms out so it’s easier to see why you died, the hotbar is visible at all times, and you can change certain settings before respawning.

![you-died.png](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/19671519855117)

These changes are available to everyone, except if you have add-ons applied. Also, the screen has limited text formatting code support, so it might look a bit different. To use the old screen, go to Settings -\> Video, and turn off ‘New “You Died” Screen (Experimental)’.  
  
We’d love to hear what you think about this change! Please share your feedback with us [here](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/19522618627981-Updated-You-Died-Experience).

## **Crawling**

-   The Crawling experimental toggle has been removed and Crawling under 1 block gaps is now fully implemented into the game
-   Updated the camera interpolation rate when crawling to match Java Edition ([MCPE-170841](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-170841))
-   Fixed some scenarios where crawling was not correctly being triggered on the server ([MCPE-171225](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-171225))

## **Recipe Unlocking**

-   Recipe Unlocking is no longer an Experimental Feature, but can still be turned on and off per world
-   You can now enable Recipe Unlocking on the Create New World screen ([MCPE-172956](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-172956))
-   The command for unlocking recipes has been updated. The autosuggestion to give a player a recipe now says "player: target" instead of "victim: target" ([MCPE-172402](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-172402))
-   ‘Recipe unlocked’ message is no longer visible on the pause menu ([MCPE-171112](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-171112))
-   Stained Glass Pane recipe now gets unlocked when obtaining any dyes ([MCPE-171118](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-171118))
-   Recipes unlocked notification now fit text in different languages and no longer bleed out of the screen ([MCPE-171141](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-171141))
-   Command line auto-complete has been added for recipe unlocking. Useful when you want to see what recipes you can unlock ([MCPE-171086](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-171086))
-   The order of command inputs was changed to be the same as on Java Edition ([MCPE-171098](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-171098))
-   Recipe Unlocking Game Rule
    -   Added an optional game rule for limited crafting. The game rule is only relevant when recipe unlocking is enabled. When set to "true" it prevents players from crafting recipes they have not yet unlocked. It is off by default and can only be modified through the "/gamerule" command.

## **Recipe Book Search**

-   The recipe book search has been updated when playing in Survival mode with the following changes:
    -   The search will only match the beginning of any word in the item's name. For example, searching for "tor" will now show **Tor**ch and Redstone **Tor**ch but not Daylight Detec**tor**)
    -   Search will now work better together with the Recipe Unlocking system - recipes that haven't been unlocked will show up in search results.
-   This change will enable experienced players to find items they are looking for (even if it hasn't been unlocked yet) while not overwhelming new players with recipes they aren't yet ready for.
-   These changes are planned for both Bedrock and Java Edition, but they are still being tweaked and we definitely want to hear your feedback! Send us your thoughts at [aka.ms/MinecraftRecipeSearch](https://aka.ms/MinecraftRecipeSearch)

## **Sleeping Percentage Gamerule**

-   Added the ‘playerssleepingpercentage’ gamerule, allowing night to be skipped when the specified percent of players logged into a world are sleeping ([MCPE-114425](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-114425))
    -   A zero or a negative value will only require one player to sleep to skip the night
    -   When set to over 100, the night cannot be skipped  
          
        

# **Vanilla Parity**

## **Block Breaking**

-   We have adjusted the breaking times of 188 blocks to match Java Edition and our intended design. Some blocks couldn't be changed yet for technical reasons and Obsidian was left unchanged because we're still deciding what breaking speed it should have. Bringing more blocks to parity makes it easier for our team to keep both versions up to date. We also hope it will be easier for the community to make and share guides that work for all players on all platforms.
    -   The full list of block breaking times and changes can be found at the very end of this changelog

# **Experimental Features**

## **Experimental Trade Changes**

-   This update includes experimental changes to the Wandering Trader and Librarian Villager trades. You must turn on this experiment in the Experiments Menu if you want to test the new trades.
-   We are trying out these changes to rebalance the villager trade system and make it more fair and fun for everyone. However, these changes are not yet final, and they will stay as experimental features while we continue to work on them. We still need your feedback to help us improve and decide, so please continue to let us know what you think of the new trades, what you like and dislike, and what suggestions you have at [aka.ms/VillagerTradingFeedback](http://aka.ms/VillagerTradingFeedback).

## **Librarian**

-   Before these changes, players could get any Village enchantment from any Librarian. A novice Librarian could sell the best enchantment in the game! For some players, this felt too random and made trading feel overpowered when compared to using the Enchanting Table or searching for Enchanted Books in structures.
-   With the new rules, Librarians from different biomes sell different enchantments. Master Librarians are guaranteed to have a special enchantment which is different in each Village biome.
-   Players will have to work towards getting the best trades instead of relying on random chance. We hope this makes Librarian trading more interesting and skilful, while also revealing some clues about their history of each Village type through the enchantments that are sold there.
-   Librarians from different biomes now sell different Enchanted Books
-   Master Librarians with full XP are guaranteed to sell a special enchantment, which is different in each Village biome
-   This means that players must visit all seven Village biomes to get the full set of Villager enchantments
-   There are two secret Village biomes where Villages do not generate
    -   A player must build these Villages to access their trades!
-   Some enchantments have been removed from Village trading and must be found in other ways

## **Wandering Trader**

-   Some players felt that the Wandering Trader had unfair prices and didn't sell many useful items. We have lowered their prices, added more trades, and increased the amounts available. The Wandering Trader will also now buy useful items from players, so it's possible to help them on their journey by giving them supplies even if you don't feel like buying anything.
-   As this is an experiment, we would really appreciate your feedback as work continues and to help us decide on the future direction for Villager trades!
-   Wandering Traders now have lower prices and have a higher amount of each item in stock
-   Wandering Traders now sell Logs
-   Wandering Traders can now buy many items, instead of only selling

## **Minimum Supported Mobile Hardware**

As Minecraft grows, so must the operating system and hardware that supports it. For some older Apple devices, you may need to update to **iOS 1****3** or above by February 2024 to continue receiving updates for Minecraft or to access online play.  If you are on the most up-to-date version of iOS already, you have nothing to worry about. Please follow Apple’s guide on how to [update your device](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204204). You can also refer to [their list of devices currently compatible with iOS 13/iPadOS13.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210327) 

For Android, as of February 2024, **devices require greater than 1 GB RAM, run OS 8 (Oreo) or above**, and have **OpenGL ES 3.0** **to run Minecraft.**
