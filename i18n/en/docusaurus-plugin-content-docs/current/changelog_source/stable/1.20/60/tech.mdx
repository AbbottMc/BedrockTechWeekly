## **Updated Add-On Template Packs**

-   Updated Add-On templates for 1.20.60 with new resources, behaviors, and documentation are available to download at [aka.ms/MCAddonPacks](https://aka.ms/MCAddonPacks)

## **General**

-   Decorated Pots now support the use of loot tables
-   Renamed _json_to _water\_splash\_manual.json_ in _resource\_packs\\vanilla\\particles_ ([MCPE-176784](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-176784))
-   Require _block\_id_ for each block in the _StartGamePacket_ blockProperties
-   Send "material" for vanilla data-driven blocks in the StartGamePacket blockProperties. "block\_id" is also moved to the "vanilla\_block\_data" object
-   Containers being cloned over no longer keep their container screens open and no longer cause crashes
-   Changing the _brightness\_gamma_ value for blocks now darkens the block correctly ([MCPE-167836](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-167836))
-   Added a "drop\_item\_slot" field to the "interact" component, which allows to specify an inventory slot to remove and drop items from
-   "behavior.breed" now interrupts navigation on stop for content using engine version 1.20.60 or higher
-   Updated listed values for the Vanilla "orientation" block state in documentation to no longer be boolean values

## **Commands**

-   _/me_ _/say_ _/title_ _/tell_
    -   Reduced max length for output message to 512 characters
-   _/kill_
    -   Reduced max length for reason message to 512 characters

## **Add-Ons and Script Engine**

-   Added a _Project Through Liquid_property to the 3D Block Cursor
-   Added a _CursorPropertiesChangeAfterEvent_ to notify Editor script when the cursor properties are changed
-   Wandering Traders can now correctly display custom entity spawn eggs in their trade menus ([MCPE-170184](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-170184))
-   The "minecraft:geometry.full\_block" identifier for the "minecraft:geometry" block component has been added
    -   The "minecraft:geometry.full\_block" identifier provides a centered 1x1x1 cube geometry
    -   When combined with a _material\_instances_ component with "render\_layer": "opaque", it enables rendering-only capabilities previously included in the "minecraft:unit\_cube" component including:
        -   Occludes both vanilla and custom neighboring full blocks
        -   Culls faces that neighbor vanilla and custom neighboring full blocks to improve rendering performance
    -   Added content error logging to help creators identify content that hits or exceeds the state bit/permutation count per block ([MCPE-177045](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-177045))

## **Biomes**

-   Biome JSON files no longer support inheriting fields from other Biome JSON files. If this affects any content those files should be updated by manually copying the desired JSON text
-   Biome tags in JSON files are now specified under a "minecraft:tags" component, in a "tags" array, rather than as loose JSON objects, for files with a format\_version of _1.20.60_ or higher

## **Blocks**

-   Added the ability for data-driven blocks to remove faces in the geometry when abutting a full and opaque block. A new field has been added to the Block Geometry Component, which references a new Culling .json file (found in the resource pack block\_culling directory) that sets up culling rules for the tessellated geometry

## **Items**

-   Unrecognized fields in component item JSON will now give a warning to the content log in format versions _1.20.60_ and higher

## **Components**

-   The "entity\_sensor" component now supports multiple "subsensors":
-   "event", "require\_all", "minimum\_count", "maximum\_count", "range" and "event\_filter" are now individually configurable fields of each subsensor
-   Subsensors also have a new "cooldown" field, which defines how often each subsensor should sense for entities
-   All these changes require a "format\_version" of _1.20.60_ or higher
-   The "interact" component now supports the additional "entity\_act" value for the "vibration" field

## **Entity Components**

-   Entity event response _run\_command_ has been renamed to _queue\_command_ and has been released out of experimental. Commands run via _queue\_command_ may be deferred until the next tick. If the entity is removed before the command is run, the command will not execute. Content using _run\_command_ under experimental will still work for now but the experimental feature is now considered deprecated
-   Added an "interact\_filters" field to the "ageable" component, which allows to specify conditions on when the actor can be fed
-   "behavior.follow\_parent" now interrupts navigation on stop for content using engine version _1.20.60_ or higher

## **Entity Filters**

-   Added new entity filter "is\_panicking", which checks if the entity is executing "behavior.panic"
-   Added new entity filter "is\_sprinting", which checks if the entity is sprinting

## **Entity Event Responses**

-   Added the "emit\_vibration" entity event response, which allows the entity to emit a vibration having the entity itself as its source
    -   The "vibration" field allows to specify the vibration to be emitted
    -   The allowed values are "shear", "entity\_act", and "entity\_interact"

## **Molang**

-   Improved the context of content logs when an evaluated Molang expressions results in an error
-   Released Molang queries from experimental
    -   _is\_cooldown\_type_
    -   _cooldown\_time_
    -   _cooldown\_time\_remaining_
    -   _relative\_block\_has\_any\_tag_
    -   _relative\_block\_has\_all\_tags_
    -   _block\_neighbor\_has\_any\_tag_
    -   _block\_neighbor\_has\_all\_tags_
    -   _block\_has\_any\_tag_
    -   _block\_has\_all\_tags_
    -   _bone\_orientation\_trs_
    -   _bone\_orientation\_matrix_
-   Added content errors that state _remaining\_durability_and _query.max\_durability_ are only to be used with Item contexts

## **Commands**

-   The health bar of mounted rideable mobs is now properly displayed ([MCPE-177696](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-177696))
-   Execute command now fails when comparing unloaded blocks ([MCPE-177195](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-177195))
-   Added a new command that will hide and reset HUD elements visibility

## **Scripting**

-   Fixed issue where _ActionFormData_ buttons could not be clicked if there were more than 255 buttons in the form
-   The "minecraft:unit\_cube" block component has been deprecated. Using it in content marked 1.20.60 and beyond will provide a content error
    -   Using content marked prior to 1.20.60 will have their "minecraft:unit\_cube" block component upgraded to a "minecraft:geometry" block component with a "minecraft:geometry.full\_block" identifier, but will maintain backwards compatibility with all behaviors
-   Added _ScriptBiomeTypes_and _ScriptBiomeType_ to allow Scripting API to enumerate the BiomeRegistry
-   Added a _findClosestBiome_function to _Dimension_ to find the closest biome of a specified type, to a given position in the world
-   The block component "minecraft:random\_ticking" is now functional again

## **Molang**

-   Changed cooldown query slot IDs to be required for container slots with more than one index, logging content errors if not provided
    -   _cooldown\_time(slotName,slotId)_
    -   _cooldown\_time\_remaining(slotName,slotId)_
    -   _is\_cooldown\_type(cooldownName,slotName,slotId)_
