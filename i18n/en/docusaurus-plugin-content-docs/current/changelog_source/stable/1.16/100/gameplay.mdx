-   Added support for the 'on\_player\_placing' trigger component
    -   Also added MoLang queries for 'cardinal\_block\_face\_placed\_on' and 'cardinal\_player\_facing' for getting placement context

## **Data-Driven Block Models**

-   Added the first pass of the new data-driven block tessellation pipeline
-   Added the "minecraft:geometry" component to allow using a block model for rendering
-   Added the "minecraft:unit\_cube" component to allow using a default unit cube for rendering. Unit cubes get some extra effects like ambient occlusion and face removal
-   Added the "minecraft:material\_instances" component to allow mapping faces and material\_instances in a geometry file to an actual material
-   Fixed smooth lighting and ambient occlusion with new data-driven blocks

## **Placement Filter**

Added "minecraft:placement\_filter" component which allows you to set conditions for where this block can be placed. This component will also kick in whenever neighboring blocks change and pop its loot if it is no longer in a valid location

-   Added serialization to Block Descriptor
-   Added static anyMatch functions to BlockDescriptor to compare a list of BlockDescriptors against: Block\*, BlockLegacy, or BlockDescriptor
-   Added a function to compare two BlockDescriptors. This covers: matching blocks, any tag of either descriptor match, block states with matching permutations
-   Changed the BlockDescriptor BlockLegacy member variable to a Block\* so we can set the block states during deferred block resolution and get the block with the states set
-   Removed all the existing Block\* json parsing

## **Schema**

-   Split 'allowed\_blocks' into 'use\_on' and 'dispense\_on'
-   'use\_on' specifies what blocks an entity placer item is allowed to be used on, omit to allow all blocks
-   'dispense\_on' specifies what blocks an entity placer item is allowed to be dispensed on, omit to allow all blocks

## **Execute Command**

-   Added support to item json events for the 'execute\_command' keyword. It supports both a string and string array format, where the string is the command intended to run. Commands are compiled at load time and executed after add/remove\_mob\_effect and teleport actions, but before other triggers for events. Commands will be segmented in sequence and randomize nodes as expected

## **Run Command**

-   Added support to entity json events for the 'run\_command' keyword alongside the current add and remove keywords. It supports both a string and string array format, where the string is the command intended to run. Commands will be run after component groups have been added and removed, and will be segmented in sequence and randomize nodes as expected

-   All types of minecarts are now data-driven
-   The 'minecraft:behavior.controlled\_by\_player' goal is now data-driven
-   Physics component's 'has\_gravity' field is now used to decide whether a mob should apply water gravity, if the mob does not have a navigation component
-   Spatial Bandwidth Optimizations are now exposed through a component, "minecraft:conditional\_bandwidth\_optimization"
-   Spatial Bandwidth Optimizations are now utilized by every actor using "minecraft:conditional\_bandwidth\_optimization"
-   Added the selector component to raw text, which can be used to print entity names in commands such as 'tellraw' and 'titleraw'
-   Pathfinding will now account for the "minecraft:scale'" component
-   Updated BrewingStand, ButtonBlock, ChestBlock, EnderChestBlock, SlabBlock, and SoulSandBlockblock types to allow path-finding and navigation ([MCPE-47075](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-47075))
-   Updated Actor Properties. Two fields that were invalid and appeared in some vanilla content will now give a content error. The field "value" on "minecraft:can\_fly" and the property "minecraft:foot\_size" should simply be removed from any entity files
-   The 'MoveToLiquidGoal**'** has been changed to use data for its target block
-   Strider now correctly executes the 'move\_to\_liquid' goal
-   Made boats use the Buoyancy component. Added two new components, the "inside\_block\_notifier" component, which fires specified events when the actor enters or exits specified blocks, and the "out\_of\_control" component, which sets a corresponding actor flag, in order to make this possible
-   Exposed new data parameters to control the behavior of Drop Item For Goal. This includes: "seconds\_before\_pickup", "cooldown", "minimum\_teleport\_distance", "max\_head\_look\_at\_height", "teleport\_offset", and "entity\_types". Check out the new Actor component documentation!

-   Added error checks to parsing of Minecraft shareables items. Displays content log if item name is invalid or the array is empty

## **Fog**

-   Created '/fog' command for managing active fog settings for players; these fog settings override fog driven from the client such as biome location of player camera
-   Updated "biomes\_client.json" to link each biome to a fog definition identifier
-   Added child object "volumetric" which contains "density" and "media\_coefficients" objects. These hold the data values used for the volumetric fog

## **Record Item Component**

-   Items can now be made records to play music in Jukeboxes
-   **Component Variables**
    -   sound\_event - A string value correseponding to a sound event in the game code. This string must be one these for music to play: "13", "cat", "blocks", "chirp", "far", "mall", "mellohi", "stal", "strad", "ward", "11", "wait", "pigstep"
    -   duration - A float value that determines how long particles are spawned from the JukeBox Block, should approximately match length of sound event
    -   comparator\_signal - An integer value that represents the strenght of the analog signal, used by the Comparator Block
-   **Examples**
    -   When added to JukeBox Block this will play the sound clip of "record.chirp"
    -   Example 1: "minecraft:record": \{ "sound\_event": "chirp", "duration": 185.0, "comparator\_signal": 4 \}

## **Items**

-   Renamed items to be consistent with the list of Java Edition items
-   Created RepairableItemComponent that data-drives how an item is repaired in game
-   Items can now override their display name with a localized 'value'. If a value is not supplied, the component will stay with its default name. If the value supplied is not in the localization file, the display name will be the value string
-   Added a Lock in Inventory component that can be applied to an item via the '/give' and '/replaceitem' commands. This prevents the item from being removed from the player's inventory, dropped, or crafted with
    -   Example of use: \`/give @s apple 1 0 \{"item\_lock": \{"mode": "lock\_in\_inventory"\}\}\`
-   Added a Lock in Slot component that can be applied to an item via the '/give' and '/replaceitem' commands. This prevents the item from being moved or removed from its slot in the player's inventory, dropped, or crafted with
    -   Example of use: '/give @s apple 1 0 \{"item\_lock": \{"mode": "lock\_in\_slot"\}\}'
-   Added a Keep on Death component which can be applied to an item via the '/give' and '/replaceitem' commands. This component prevents the item from being dropped when the player dies
    -   Example of use: '/give @s apple 1 0 \{"keep\_on\_death": \{\}\}'

## **Item Icon Component**

-   Items now have an easy way to set the icon for an item for displaying in the user interface
-   **Component Variables**
    -   "texture": Full path to icon image to use as item's icon. No default
    -   "frame": Molang script to be executed at runtime to determine the icon's current frame. Can be a constant, defaults to: 0
    -   "legacy\_texture\_id": The name of the texture used on legacy items. No default
    -   "legacy\_frame": Molang script to be executed at runtime to determine the icon's current frame. Can be a constant, defaults to: 0

## **Item Parsing**

-   'any\_tag' functionality added to several actor components. In addition to representing items as item names in json they can now be represented as a set of tags
-   Examples:
    -   "item": \{"any\_tag": "food"\}
    -   "item": \{"any\_tag": \["food", "wood"\]\}
    -   "bribe\_items": \["emerald", \{"any\_tag": "stone"\}\]
-   Components and fields that can now use 'any\_tag' functionality:
    -   'minecraft:ageable'
    -   'minecraft:breedable' breed\_items
    -   'minecraft:bribeable' bribe\_items
    -   'minecraft:giveable' items
    -   'minecraft:healable' items

## **Animations**

-   Added a new 'loop\_delay'field to skeletal animation files that controls how to wait between each iteration of a looping animation
-   Fixed a bug where 'start\_delay'fields in skeletal animations were being used for both the initial delay before playing an animation and for inter-loop delays

## **MoveTowardsRestrictionGoal**

-   This goal has been removed in favor of the two new child goals that make the behavior clearer. The behavior works the same, but is now separated out properly into the two goals

## **MoveTowardsDwellingRestrictionGoal**
