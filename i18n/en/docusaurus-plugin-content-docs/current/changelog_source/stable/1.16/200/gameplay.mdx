**Posted:** December 8, 2020

A new update is upon us in the form of Minecraft 1.16.200! This update is loaded with graphics enhancements on Windows 10, updated volume settings, parity changes, and a swath of bug fixes. Please report any bugs you find on [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/) and post feedback to [feedback.minecraft.net](https://feedback.minecraft.net/).  
  

## **RenderDragon:**

-   RenderDragon, the new graphics engine for Minecraft Bedrock platforms, is now available on Windows 10
-   RenderDragon was developed by the Mojang Studios graphics team to give our game greater performance, stability, and flexibility. The new architecture of RenderDragon enables our developers to bring new graphics features such as physically based rendering (PBR) and ray tracing more easily to the game
-   RenderDragon has been available for Xbox and PlayStation hardware since 2019, and we are now bringing it to Windows 10. We plan to bring RenderDragon to all Minecraft Bedrock platforms, including mobile devices, in the future  
      
    

## **Minecraft with Ray Tracing:**

-   Enabled Ray Tracing on Windows 10 with compatible graphics hardware

-   Players can dramatically change the look and feel of the game. Immerse yourself in volumetric fog. See Minecraft in a whole new light with a cutting-edge dynamic lighting system, Ray Tracing
-   Players can also experience advanced kinds of block textures including metallic surfaces, bump maps, normal maps, and light emission (Glowy, reflective dirt blocks? Yes, please!)
-   Be sure to check out the [**Frequently Asked Questions**](https://aka.ms/ray-tracing-FAQ) article for an in-depth look at Ray Tracing features
-   Content in the Marketplace is now aware of Ray Tracing capabilities and will display a label indicating support within the user interface
-   **Creators:** We have some new documentation available for creating content for Minecraft with Ray Tracing!

## **Minecraft with OpenXR:**

-   Minecraft on Windows 10 now uses OpenXR to support Windows MR and Oculus VR

![openxr.jpg](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/article_attachments/360078247172/openxr.jpg)

-   OpenXR is an open-source, royalty-free API standard that provides engines native access to a wide range of devices from vendors that span across VR/MR devices
-   OpenXR implementation in Minecraft brings a more unified experience across current VR/MR devices as well as support for those yet to come
-   You will still be able to launch through the Mixed Reality Portal, as well as the Oculus Store. However, there is also a URL to launch in VR:
    -   **minecraft://mode/?OpenXR=true**
    -   This can be made into a desktop shortcut, pinned to the start menu, bookmarked in a browser, or anything else you can do with a URL  
          
        

## **New Features:**

## **New Volume Settings**

-   Added a variety of volume sliders for sound categories (eg. hostile, blocks, weather etc.)
    -   These play a preview of the relevant sounds in the main settings menu, and play the default click sound when in-game
