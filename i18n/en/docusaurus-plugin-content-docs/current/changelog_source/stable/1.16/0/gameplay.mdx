## **Nether Wastes**

-   The original Nether biome is now called Nether Wastes

## **Nether Biome Fog**

-   Biome fog color smoothly blends between biomes. Smooth.  
      
    

## **New Mobs:**

## **Piglins**

-   Piglins are an aggressive civilization that live in the Nether
-   They mostly hang around in the Crimson Forest, but you might find some in the Nether Wastes, too
-   They think of players as target practice and will attack on sight
-   However, if you dress appropriately, they will see you as a respectable figure, or tolerable at least
-   Piglins are suspicious of strangers and if they see you opening a chest or mining a block of gold, they will assume that you're stealing and will treat you accordingly
-   Piglins LOVE gold and get very distracted by gold items
-   Gold ingots are currency to piglins, and you can throw ingots at them or interact with them while holding an ingot to barter for various goods
-   Piglins sometimes get hungry and hunt hoglins for food. Or they try at least. The results... vary
-   Piglins prefer to hunt and fight in groups and when a fight is happening, everyone wants in
-   Piglins that somehow end up in the overworld become zombified fairly quickly
-   Piglins are creeped out by soul fire and zombified piglins, and will stay clear whenever possible
-   Wither skeletons are a historic enemy and piglins will attack on sight
-   Baby piglins are not as dangerous but they can be mischievous, so watch your back
-   ... and they like to play with baby hoglins

## **Hoglins**

-   Hoglins are big aggressive beasts that live in Crimson Forests
-   They attack players on sight so be careful, they can easily knock you off a ledge!
-   Hoglins drop pork and sometimes leather, but not willingly
-   You can breed hoglins by feeding them crimson fungi, but do so at your own risk
-   Hoglins get hunted by piglins sometimes, but they don't go down without a fight!
-   Despite this, hoglins and piglins aren't enemies - they are more like an ecosystem
-   Baby hoglins like to pretend they are tough - but don't worry, they are more like angry puppies with no teeth
-   Want to keep hoglins off your back? Pro tip: Hoglins hate the smell of warped fungi!

## **Strider**

-   Striders are neutral mobs that stride the Nether, preferably through lava
-   Striders can be mounted if they first get a saddle placed on them
-   Similar to pigs, they can be controlled by the player, using mushroom-on-a-stick!
-   They are not hostile
-   They spawn in lava, and are fire immune
-   When they are not in lava, they freeze, shiver, and move slower
-   You can breed striders by feeding them warped fungus
-   Baby striders follow their parents

## **Zombified Piglins**

-   Zombie pigmen are now known as zombified piglins, and they now have ears... well, at least one ear

## **Zoglins**

-   Zoglins are zombified hoglins - the result of bringing a hoglin into the overworld
-   Unlike hoglins, they can't be bred or fed, and they don't care about warped fungus
-   Beware - these beasts are raving mad and attack just about everything they see!  
      
    

## **New Gameplay Features:**

## **Ruined Portals**

-   Remains of ancient Nether portals can now be found in the Nether and Overworld!

## **Bastion Remnants**

What's made of Blackstone and full of Piglins and Hoglins? Bastion Remnants!

-   Added 4 separate Bastion Remnant types: Bridge, Hoglin Stable, Housing Units, and Treasure Room
-   You can find these sizable structures in all biomes in the Nether, except for the ashy cliffs of Basalt Deltas
-   Explore, loot, and conquer a Bastion Remnant to call it your home...but beware, Piglins don't take kindly to intruders stealing their things

## **Blackstone**

The only stone whose color is almost as dark as the humor of Mojang's former writer and friend, Tom Stone!

## **Respawn Anchor**

-   Use while holding Glowstone to charge to a maximum of four charges - each respawn depletes one charge

## **Netherite**

-   Netherite items float in lava so you don't lose all your gear after that unplanned lava bath
-   Netherite tools work faster and last longer than diamond
-   Netherite weapons do more damage than diamond
-   Netherite armor have higher toughness and durability than diamond
-   Netherite items have higher enchantment value than diamond (but not as high as gold)
-   Netherite armor gives you knockback resistance, so you barely get knocked back at all when hit by arrows and such- Netherite blocks can be used as the base of a beacon and netherite ingots can be used as the fuel for a beacon. Weird flex but ok
-   And it looks cool!

## **Crafting Netherite**

-   Mine ancient debris in the lower depths of the Nether. At own risk. No insurance coverage for that
-   Refine it into netherite scrap in a furnace or blast furnace
-   Combine 4 netherite scrap with 4 gold ingots in a crafting table to make a netherite ingot

## **Crating Netherite Tools and Armor**

-   Add one of your diamond tools or armor pieces into a Smithing Table with a netherite ingot
-   The Smithing Table will preview your new netherite item in the right slot. Take it out to craft!

## **Target Block**

Because let's face it, your aim could use some practice

-   The closer you hit to the center, the larger the redstone signal!
-   You will need one hay block and four redstone for this recipe

## **Soul Speed**

Never suffer again drudging through Soul Sand Valleys - Soul Speed has you covered!

-   Shine your boots of choice with this soul-sucking enchantment to speed around on Soul Sand and Soul Soil!
-   There's a downside: Enchantments will slowly degrade your boots each Soul block you walk on
-   Can only be obtained by bartering with those pesky Piglins

## **Lodestone**

A new block that can help you get your bearings!

-   Crafted from a netherite ingot and chiseled stone bricks
-   Use a compass on a lodestone to point the compass to that lodestone

    -   So Below is played in Soulsand Valleys
-   Added moody sounds to the Nether

## **Emotes:**

## **Parity:**

## **Mob Despawning**

-   Bedrock mob despawn rules have been changed to now work similarly to Java Edition's mob despawn rules. This allows mobs to more consistently despawn around the player
-   Any mobs that have been set to persist (tempted, name-tagged, tamed, bred, etc.) will never naturally despawn
-   Almost all naturally spawning mobs will automatically despawn when they're 44 blocks or further away from the nearest players in a world with simulation distance 4. On higher simulation distances, mobs are despawned when they're in a chunk at the edge of the simulation distance up to a distance or 128 blocks from the nearest player
-   Fish automatically despawn at a max range of 40 blocks or further on all simulation distances
-   If mobs are between 32 and 44 blocks from the nearest player, they must not take damage for 30 seconds as well as succeeding a 1 in 800 chance

## **Pickup Items Goal**

-   The PickupItemsGoal only considers items that the mob can reach
    -   When determining whether the goal can be used, we now check whether the mob can reach an item it’s interested in, before committing to it as the target of the goal. This is to avoid mobs getting stuck in this goal after deciding to pick up an item they cannot reach
-   PickupBasedOnChance variable
    -   This new variable was added to be used for monsters that can pick up items sometimes but also preserve mobs that used this goal in the past like Villagers. If this variable is true, the mob will have a calculation done (based on things like time played by the player, game difficulty, and moon brightness) to determine if this is a mob that is allowed to pick up items. That value is only calculated on the mob’s first spawn, which means it is forever saved on that mob and doesn’t change. If the variable is false (which it is by default), the mob will always be able to pick up items using the goal
-   CanPickupAnyItem variable
    -   The PickupItemsGoal is dependent on the ShareableComponent and the items that are added to its items list. This new variable overrides that list and tells the component that this mob can pick up any item even if it isn’t in the list. Items picked up because of this variable still honor the priority set to items in the list of items, however. This means that any items with a set priority in the list will still be picked up over any item that may be picked up because of this variable. By default, it is set to false
-   CooldownAfterBeingAttacked variable
    -   The variable cooldown\_after\_being\_attacked has been added to the goal, specifying for how many seconds after being attacked the goal should be unavailable. The default value is 0
-   CanPickupToHandOrEquipment variable
    -   Specifying if the mob can equip items that it picks up or put items in its hand, or if it belongs in the inventory

## **Shareable Component**

-   Component Variables
    -   item/barter - If true the mob will try to activate the barter goal after picking up the item, default value is false
    -   item/admire - If true the mob will try to activate the admire goal after picking up the item, default value is false
    -   item/consume\_item - Specifies if an item should be consumed, for instance Piglins consume (eat) porkchop. Default value is false
    -   item/stored\_in\_inventory - Specifies if the item is desired to be picked up and stored in the mob’s inventory. Default value is false

## **Splash Text**

-   The Splash Text loading code has been augmented to allow splash text JSON files to be additive, rather than replacing them completely, and to allow some conditional statements to disable splash text entries. Use a field called "canMerge" that sits next to the "splashes" field, it is a bool that defaults to 'false'. Also, another sibling of "splashes" is "conditional", which is an array of objects. Those objects contain a "requires" field and a "splashes" field. The "splashes" field is an array of strings like the original "splashes" field, and the "requires" field contains three fields - "platforms", "treatments", and "stores", each of which is an array of strings that is compared with the relevant data
