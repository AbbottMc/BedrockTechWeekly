## Add-Ons and Script Engine

-   Added the ability to define the order for the items for the creative inventory & recipe book, called the crafting item catalog, for new items added by packs. New items can either merge with existing groups, create new groups with your own item for the icon, or just become added as loose items without a group. This catalog should be saved as `item_catalog/crafting_item_catalog.json` in your behavior pack

Example:

    \{
       "format_version": "1.21.60",
       "minecraft:crafting_items_catalog": \{
          "categories": [
             \{
                // Valid values are construction, equipment, nature, and items
                "category_name": "construction",
                "groups": [
                   \{
                      // This will add the items to the end of the
                      // existing planks group
                      "group_identifier": \{
                         "icon": "minecraft:oak_planks",
                         "name": "minecraft:itemGroup.name.planks"
                      \},
                      "items": [
                         "mynamespace:my_planks1",
                         "mynamespace:my_planks2"
                      ]
                   \},
                   \{
                      // This will create a new group
                      "group_identifier": \{
                         "icon": "mynamespace:my_item",
                         // This is the name of your group which doubles as
                         // the localization string. The namespace is required
                         "name": "mynamespace:my_group_name"
                      \},
                      "items": [
                         "mynamespace:my_item"
                      ]
                   \},
                   \{
                      // This adds items without being part of a
                      // group as loose items
                      "items": [
                         "mynamespace:my_loose_item"
                      ]
                   \}
                ]
             \}
          ]
       \}
    \}
    

-   Item and Block json files now require a namespace for group names in the "menu\_category" object.

-   Removed content log error: 'Block needs both a geometry and material instances component'
    

## Cameras

-   Focus Target Camera is released. Its associated experimental toggle is removed ("Creator Cameras: Focus Target Camera")

    -   "combine\_parent\_colors", If a color mutation will not happen, the baby will get a combination of the parents' colors if the colors are compatible.

## Fog

-   Fixed issue where "inherit\_from\_prior\_fog" field in biomes\_client.json was ignored on first content on resource pack stack ([MCPE-187805](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-187805))

## Gameplay

-   Fixed a bug where opening a chest while the clone command is spamming could crash the server.

-   Single-channel textures in resource packs are now interpreted as grayscale, rather than red. This change does not apply to single-channel UI textures, which were already interpreted as such
    
-   client\_biome JSON files now support a "surface\_opacity" field in the "minecraft:water\_appearance" component
    
    -   This change also restores swampland and warm\_ocean surface opacity to what they were until recently when the client\_biome JSON files were introduced

## Items

-   Added "base" parameter to block sounds specifying another block sound they should use sounds for if they do not define a sound themselves

## Stability and Performance

-   Players on Switch should remain signed into their Microsoft Account after putting Minecraft app to sleep and resuming it.
    
-   Removed redundant biome data from chunks and improved World Template generation stability.
    
-   Made changes to add up to 4% CPU performance improvement on Switch
    




<h2 className="experimental_divider">Experimental Features</h2>




## Aim Assist

## **Script API**

<Switcher techSapi={<TechSapiExp/>} techSapiDiff={undefined}/>

## Commands

-   Place: Entities saved within structures will now be placed unless specified
-   Added two subcommands to the `/place` command behind the Upcoming Creator Features Experiment toggle
    
    -   `/place feature`
    -   `/place featurerule`
-   `RegistrationBuilder.structureLocation` method in @minecraft/server-gametest
    
    -   Added optional argument `structureDimension: DimensionTye | string` to specify which dimension the gametest should spawn in. If not provided, it will default to whichever dimension the test is ran from.
-   `system.scriptEvent()` no longer returns `ScriptEventMessageSizeError` but instead an `InvalidArgumentError` for the message size exceeding 2048 characters in size in Beta
    
-   Removed `ScriptEventMessageSizeError` from Beta
    
-   Moved CameraTargetOptions from beta to `v1.16.0`

-   Added support for ItemTags in match\_tool loot table conditions behind the Upcoming Creator Features Experiment toggle

### Components

-   Removing a waterlogged custom block using the `minecraft:liquid_detection` component with `stopsLiquidFlowingFromDirection` enabled for all directions now results in flowing water rather than a stagnant block of water.

## Molang

-   Moved `query.last_input_mode_is_any` to stable. It takes one or more arguments ('keyboard\_and\_mouse', 'touch', 'gamepad', or 'motion\_controller'). If the last input used is any of the specified string values, returns 1.0. Otherwise returns 0.0. Available on the Client (Resource Packs) only.
-   Moved `query.touch_only_affects_hotbar` to stable. It returns 1.0 if the touch input only affects the touchbar, otherwise returns 0.0. Available on the Client (Resource Packs) only.

## Scripting API

-   Moved enum `InputMode` from `beta` to `1.17.0`.
-   Moved class `InputInfo` from `beta` to `1.17.0`.
    -   Moved property `lastInputModeUsed` from `beta` to `1.17.0`.
    -   Moved property `touchOnlyAffectsHotbar` from `beta` to `1.17.0`.

-   Structure
    -   Added `waterlogged: boolean` parameter to `setBlockPermutation`. This can be used to set whether the specified block within a structure is waterlogged.
-   Removed `ScriptBlockType.canBeWaterlogged` from Beta - instead, `ScriptBlock.canContainLiquid` or `ScriptBlockPermutation.canContainLiquid` can be used to check if a block can be waterlogged.

## Stability and Performance

-   Resolved a crash that could occur when using top\_layer\_modification in custom jigsaw structures
-   Resolved a crash that could occur when entering the nether with a custom jigsaw structure in the nether
-   Experimental support for applying a service-driven texture memory budget in low memory situations. When enabled, memory will be conserved by progressively reducing resolution of some textures as usage approaches the budgeted limit.

## User Interface

-   Added a new radio button to allow players to select if they want Deferred Video Settings to favor performance or favor visuals.
