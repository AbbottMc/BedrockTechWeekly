A hotfix is now available for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition that resolves some issues introduced with the latest update.

# **Minecraft Preview for PlayStation®5:**

We have some exciting news for our PlayStation®5 community! **Today we’re launching the first preview of a native version of Minecraft for the Sony PlayStation®5** – and we need your help to test it!

## **If you own the PS4® version of Minecraft for your PS5®, you’ll be able to access and test this early version by navigating to “Settings” and then “Preview” within the game.** This preview includes the new Tricky Trials Update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more – all while trying out a version of Minecraft that’s designed for your console! As this is a preview version, we’ll need your help in hunting bugs (and we’re not talking about the silverfish spawning from trial spawners), as well as gathering any feedback.
