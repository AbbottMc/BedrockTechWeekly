**Posted:** 22 October 2024

Today marks the launch of our third game drop: Bundles of Bravery! Featuring space-saving bundles and the hardest Survival mode out there (Hardcore mode!) this drop is all about embarking on a new adventure, collecting everything you can along the way, and definitely _not_ dying. Given Hardcore mode brings hardcore stakes, we really can’t recommend backing up your Hardcore worlds enough – especially if you’ll be playing the new drop on low internet speeds (Read more about these bugs [here](#user-content-%3Ca-name%3D%22accordian%22%3Ehardcore-mode%3C%2Fa%3E)!). If that wasn’t enough stuff to stuff into a changelog, we’ve also fixed over 140 bugs, increased the spawn rate for bats above ground (because they’re cute, and more players should see them) and made a heap of technical changes for creators. Goodness, that was a lot, wasn’t it! Perhaps I should’ve stuffed it all into a bundle?

# Features and Bug Fixes

## Hardcore Mode

A new game mode for Bedrock Edition!

-   You can't turn off Hardcore mode after creating this world
-   The game is locked to the highest difficulty
-   There are no second chances. If you die, it's game over!
-   Upon death, you can only respawn as a spectator. You can still explore your world and watch others, but you’ll no longer be able to interact or rebuild

\> _**Developer's Note:** We’re confident that Hardcore mode will run smoothly for most Bedrock players, but we’re still working on quashing some smaller bugs. Two of these impact multiplayer gameplay – one related to low internet speeds, and another when replacing a Creative mode Realm with a Hardcore mode world. While we develop a fix for these final bugs, we recommend all players regularly back up their worlds and check below for more detailed information on factors that might trigger them._

## Bundles

A Bundle is an item that lets you stack different blocks or items together in the same inventory slot. Different items normally don’t stack together, so you can end up wasting space by only having a few items in each slot. A Bundle lets you pack those items together so there is no wasted space.

-   A Bundle is an item that can pack different items together into the same stack
-   A Bundle only fits one stack (usually 64 items) but it can be a mixture of many different item types
-   You can insert items into a Bundle directly in the inventory
-   Bundles have a tooltip that shows the items inside
    -   If a Bundle has less than 12 item types inside, the tooltip will show all of them
    -   Otherwise, the tooltip will show the top three rows of items and the others will be hidden below
-   You can select any of the visible items to pull out of the Bundle
    -   Use the scroll wheel on mouse, the right stick on a game controller, or tap on a touch device
-   When selecting an item to remove, the Bundle icon shows that item poking out of the Bundle
-   When holding a Bundle in hand, you can empty it onto the ground
-   The Bundle is crafted with one String above one Leather

\> **Developer's Note:** _The original prototype for Bundles was much more expensive to craft and used Rabbit Hide, which is only available in certain biomes, so the player had to explore to get their first Bundle. In this version we've made it cheaper and something that you can craft at home in almost any biome. We want it to be easy to get Bundles in a new world so you can use it in your early adventures._

    -   Stone was moved into the Stone group, finally ([MCPE-116364](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-116364))

-   Players hitting the edge of the generated world will keep their velocity. Example: While flying with the Elytra, the player will stay floating instead of losing all speed instantly

## [Hardcore Mode](#user-content-%3Ca-name%3D%22accordian%22%3Ehardcore-mode%3C%2Fa%3E)

Here are some of the bugs that we've fixed that could be especially troubling when playing in Hardcore mode!

-   Fixed an issue where End Gateway Portals could teleport some players incorrectly ([MCPE-66061](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-66061))
-   Fixed a bug that could sometimes cause the player to get pushed when pillaring up ([REALMS-9874](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/REALMS-9874))
-   Fixed issues with taking random fall damage ([MCPE-120140](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-120140) , [MCPE-136406](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-136406))

## **Known Issues:** These are some of the issues that may rarely occur, and may be worse when playing on a world with a slow connection

-   Rain/snow sometimes does not visually match the actual weather ([MCPE-131325](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-131325))
-   Blocks sometimes disappear when placed ([MCPE-112420](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-112420))

## **Known Realms Issue:**

-   Replacing an existing Realms Creative world with a Hardcore world, or vice versa, may corrupt some world settings for the newly-uploaded world. It is safest to only replace a Survival mode world with a Hardcore mode world to avoid this issue.

## VR / MR

-   Our ability to support VR/MR devices has come to an end, and will no longer be supported in updates after March of 2025, when you will receive your final update. After you receive the final update, you will still receive updates on your PC and be able to play without a VR/MR device. From this point on you can keep building in your worlds, and your Marketplace purchases (including Minecoins) will continue to be available on a non-VR/MR graphics device such as a computer monitor. You will no longer be able to use your VR/MR device with Minecraft as it will no longer be supported in the latest updates.
