## **Structures**

### **Trial Chambers**

-   Trial Chambers are a new structure in the Overworld where players can explore and take on combat challenges
    -   Made out of a variety of Copper and Tuff blocks, and can be found in different sizes
    -   A relatively common find throughout the Deepslate layer of the underground
    -   Natural mob spawning does not occur inside, similar to Ancient Cities
    -   Never starts inside a Deep Dark biome, but can sometimes overlap it
-   The layout of each Trial Chamber is procedurally generated, and can include traps, rewards and a variety of combat areas
    -   Decorated Pots line the corridors and hold hidden treasures
    -   Supply Barrels can be found between different rooms, and give you blocks and items which help you navigate your trials
    -   Vaults are guarded by challenges in each room, and can be a source of many high level Enchanted Books and equipment including a very rare chance to receive a Trident
    -   Ominous Vaults can be found in harder to reach places and give even better loot than standard Vaults, including some items which are exclusive to Ominous Vaults
-   Each Trial Chamber will include Trial Spawners with a melee, small melee, or ranged category:
    -   Melee
        -   Zombie
        -   Husk
        -   Spider
    -   Small Melee
        -   Slime
        -   Cave Spider
        -   Baby Zombie
        -   Silverfish
    -   Ranged
        -   Skeleton
        -   Stray
        -   Bogged
-   Each Trial Spawner category will only use one mob for the entire structure when generated, and these mobs are randomized for each Trial Chamber
    -   For example, one Trial Chamber might only spawn Zombies, Cave Spiders and Strays, while another might only spawn Spiders, Silverfish and Skeletons
    -   The exceptions to this are some Trial Spawners in unique rooms which always spawn Breezes

## **Mobs**

### **Breeze**

-   A cunning hostile mob spawned by some Trial Spawners in Trial Chamber rooms
    -   Drops 1-2 Breeze Rods when killed by a player
    -   The number of Breeze Rods dropped is affected by looting enchantments
-   Moves primarily by leaping around its target
-   Deflects almost all projectiles, making it immune to ranged combat
    -   With one notable exception: it cannot deflect Wind Charges
-   An aggressive adversary, it shoots volatile wind energy in the form of Wind Charge projectiles at its target
    -   After colliding with an entity or a block, Wind Charge projectiles produce a Wind Burst, which knocks back entities in the area
    -   Wind Charges deal a small amount of damage when colliding directly with an entity
    -   Wind Charges break decorated pots and chorus flower blocks upon collision
-   Wind Bursts have the effect of 'activating' certain blocks:
    -   Non-Iron Doors and Trapdoors are flipped
    -   Fence Gates are flipped
    -   Buttons are pressed
    -   Levers are flipped
    -   Bells are rung and swung
    -   Lit Candles are extinguished
-   Wind Bursts do not have any effect on Iron Doors, Iron Trapdoors, or any block being held in its position by a Redstone signal
-   Will not retaliate against attacks from the following mobs: Skeletons, Strays, Bogged, Zombies, Husks, Spiders, Cave Spiders and Slimes
    -   The same mobs will not retaliate against a Breeze when hurt by its Wind Charge projectile

### **Bogged**

-   A new variant of Skeletons that shoots poisonous arrows
    -   They're easier to take down with 16 health instead of 20 health
    -   They attack at a slower interval of 3.5 seconds instead of 2 seconds
-   Has a chance to drop Arrows of Poison when killed by players
-   These mossy and mushroom covered Skeletons spawn naturally in Swamps and Mangrove Swamps
    -   Can also be found spawning from Trial Spawners in some Trial Chambers
-   Drops 2 mushrooms when sheared (either both red, both brown, or one of each)

## **Weapons**

### **Mace**

-   A new heavy weapon to smash your enemies!
    -   Has a base damage of 5
    -   Can be crafted with a Breeze Rod and a Heavy Core
    -   Using it will decrease its durability like any other weapon; can be repaired with Breeze Rods at an Anvil
-   Has a unique attack called the smash attack. When the player falls more than 1.5 blocks before hitting, a smash attack is triggered which has multiple effects:
    -   Safe Fall: Resets all vertical momentum and negates any fall-damage accumulated from the fall
    -   Extra Damage: Does more damage the further the player fell before hitting the target with it:
        -   For the first 3 blocks fallen: Add 4 damage per block
        -   For the next 5 blocks fallen: Add 2 damage per block
        -   For any blocks fallen after: Add 1 damage per block
    -   Great Knockback: Other entities near the struck enemy will be knocked back by the immense force of the Mace
-   Can be used in combination with Wind Charges to launch up and deliver devastating smash attacks to enemies
-   These existing enchantments can be applied to the Mace:
    -   Mending
    -   Unbreaking
    -   Smite
    -   Bane of Arthropods
    -   Fire Aspect
    -   Curse of Vanishing
-   The Mace also has 3 exclusive enchantments: Density, Breach and Wind Burst

## **Enchantments**

Three new enchantments have been added which are exclusive to the Mace:

-   Density
    -   Common Enchantment, accessible in the Enchanting Table and on Enchanted Books in random loot chests
    -   Has 5 levels
    -   Maces enchanted with Density do more damage per fallen block per Density level
        -   Damage dealt per fallen block is increased by 0.5 per level of Density
    -   Mutually exclusive with Breach, Smite, and Bane of Arthropods
-   Breach
    -   Rare Enchantment, accessible in the Enchanting Table and on Enchanted Books in random loot chests
    -   Has 4 levels
    -   Maces enchanted with Breach reduce the effectiveness of armor on the target
        -   The effectiveness of the armor is reduced by 15% per Breach level
    -   Mutually exclusive with Density, Smite, and Bane of Arthropods
-   Wind Burst
    -   Unique enchantment which can only be found in Ominous Vaults
        -   Only Wind Burst I can be found, higher levels must be obtained by combining them in an Anvil
    -   Has 3 levels
    -   Maces enchanted with Wind Burst will emit a Wind Burst upon hitting an enemy, launching the attacker upward and enabling the linking of smash attacks one after the other
    -   Successfully landing a Wind Burst attack causes the player to lose the fall damage protection they would otherwise have from landing a successful smash attack
    -   Each level will bounce the attacker an additional 7 blocks into the air

## **Blocks**

### **Crafter**

-   A new block that enables the crafting of items and blocks via Redstone
    -   Can be crafted with 5 Iron Ingots, 2 Redstone Dust, 1 Crafting Table and 1 Dropper
-   Will eject one crafting result at a time when powered by a Redstone pulse
    -   Its current powered state is indicated by Redstone crystals on its back face, which will light up
    -   The crafting grid on its top face will light up red when it successfully crafts a recipe
-   Upon receiving a signal, it will eject the recipe result from the front face
    -   If the recipe output has any remainder items (such as a Bucket), the result and remainder items will be ejected together
-   When placed, the front face of the Crafter will face towards the player

### **Crafter User Interface**

-   Has a 3x3 interactable crafting grid
-   The crafting grid slots are toggleable, meaning that the player can change the behavior of a slot by interacting with it while not holding an item
-   A slot that is ‘toggled’ cannot hold any items
    -   Other blocks such as Hoppers and Droppers also cannot place items into them
-   Unlike the Crafting Table, the Crafter displays a preview of the crafted item which will be crafted and ejected on the next Redstone pulse, but cannot be manually taken out by the player
    -   The arrow pointing out from the recipe grid will light up red when the Crafter is currently powered
-   The Crafter User Interface is shared between all players interacting with it, meaning that multiple players can interact with the Crafter at the same time, similar to Chests and Hoppers

### **Crafter Interaction with Other Blocks**

-   The signal strength of a Comparator reading a Crafter is 0-9, where each non-empty or toggled slot adds 1 strength
-   Hoppers and Minecarts with Hoppers can be used to both insert and extract items from the Crafter
-   Droppers can be used to insert items into the Crafter
-   Items inserted from another block (ex: Hopper, Dropper) will fill the Crafter's slots based on these rules:
    -   Prioritize the first empty slot (from left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
    -   If there are no empty slots, then prioritize the smallest stack of the same item (pick the first if there are multiple)
    -   If there is a toggled slot it will be skipped. The item will then be moved into the container
    -   If the item cannot be moved, it will be ejected into the world
-   Items are removed from Crafters by Hoppers and Minecarts with Hoppers in the same order as from other containers like Chests

### **Trial Spawner**

-   A new variant of Monster Spawners that ejects rewards upon defeat
    -   Cannot be crafted nor obtained by players in Survival - instead, they can be found naturally throughout Trial Chambers
    -   Very slow to mine and resistant to explosions, and will not drop even with Silk Touch
    -   Cannot be moved by Pistons
-   The challenge level will increase for each new player a Trial Spawner notices nearby
    -   The challenge level will not decrease until it is reset during a Trial Spawner's cooldown
    -   Trial Spawners can only notice players which are in line of sight, and will ignore Creative and Spectator players
-   Unlike normal Spawners, a Trial Spawner will spawn a limited number of mobs proportional to its current challenge level
    -   It can only spawn a mob at positions that are within line of sight
    -   It can spawn a mob regardless of any light level requirement the mob has
    -   Spawned mobs are persistent
-   Once all mobs are defeated, the Trial Spawner will eject a number of rewards which is proportional to the current challenge level
    -   After the rewards have been ejected, the Trial Spawner goes into cooldown for 30 minutes, during which it will no longer spawn mobs
-   When placed in Creative, Trial Spawners have no mob type set by default
    -   The mob type can be set by interacting with it while holding a Spawn Egg
-   Has an Ominous Trial Spawner variant, accessible through an Ominous Trial

### **Vault**

-   A block that holds locked treasure and loot - players must find the right key to eject its rewards
    -   Can be found throughout Trial Chambers, containing the structures' most valuable loot
    -   Vaults in Trial Chambers require a Trial Key to be unlocked
    -   Cannot be crafted nor obtained in Survival, and does not drop anything when mined
    -   Explosion resistant and cannot be moved by Pistons
-   Can be unlocked by an unlimited number of players
    -   After a player has unlocked a Vault, they cannot personally unlock that Vault again
    -   If a player has not unlocked a particular Vault before, this can be seen by an orange stream of particles that flow from the player to that Vault when nearby
-   Has a keyhole that will be open or closed depending on the players nearby
    -   If any nearby player has not unlocked that Vault, the keyhole will be open
    -   If all nearby players have unlocked that Vault, the keyhole will be closed
-   Within its cage, it will cycle through and display items which are possible to eject from its loot table
    -   Players cannot time their unlocks to eject the item that is currently displayed in the cage
-   The loot it ejects is randomized each time it is unlocked
-   Has an Ominous Vault variant, unlockable through an Ominous Trial

    -   Chiseled Copper
    -   Copper Grate

### **Copper Grate**

-   A new type of decorative block unique to the Copper family

    -   Transparent and allows light to pass through
    -   Mobs cannot suffocate inside them
    -   Cannot conduct Redstone
    -   Hostile mobs cannot naturally spawn on them
    -   Can hold water

### **Copper Bulb**

-   A light-emitting block that can toggle its light emission through Redstone pulses
-   Oxidizes like other Copper blocks, and emits light based on oxidation level
    -   Copper Bulb: Light level 15
    -   Exposed Copper Bulb: Light level 12
    -   Weathered Copper Bulb: Light level 8
    -   Oxidized Copper Bulb: Light level 4
-   When placed, its light is off by default
    -   While it is unpowered, it will toggle its light on or off when it receives a Redstone pulse
    -   Its light will stay on even when the Redstone source is removed, and will only toggle off when it receives another Redstone pulse
-   A Redstone crystal can be seen in its center while it is powered by a Redstone signal
-   Similar to Glass Blocks, it does not conduct Redstone power
-   Comparators reading a Copper Bulb will output a signal strength of 15 if the Copper Bulb's light is on
-   The crafting recipe for 4 Copper Bulbs is:
    -   3 Copper Blocks of a shared oxidation level
    -   1 Blaze Rod
    -   1 Redstone Dust

### **Copper Doors and Trapdoors**

-   Copper variants of Doors and Trapdoors that can oxidize over time and be waxed

    -   Can be stacked to 64
-   Ominous Bottles can be found uncommonly in any Vaults, and are dropped by Raid Captains which are defeated outside a Raid

### **Wind Charge**

-   Become the Breeze! Using this item will fire off a Wind Charge projectile similar to the Breeze's
    -   Can be used to launch entities away from the impact of the Wind Burst
    -   Grants 10% more knockback than a Breeze's, but has a much smaller area of impact
    -   Deals damage if it hits an entity directly
    -   Has a half-second cooldown after each use
    -   Can be fired from a Dispenser
-   Players can use Wind Charges to propel themselves high into the air
    -   Players that launch themselves with a Wind Charge only accumulate fall damage below the height of where they collided with the Wind Burst

### **Ominous Events**

-   Bad Omen has been expanded to give access to an optional experience in Trial Chambers
-   These optional experiences can be accessed through Bad Omen, and are now known as Ominous Events
    -   They are more challenging than usual, and are designed to shake up the experience in unique ways
    -   Raids are an example of an existing Ominous Event
-   As a result, Bad Omen has a new, shadowy icon and a sound for being applied to the player
    -   It is no longer given to players that defeat a Raid Captain outside a Raid
    -   Instead, players can gain access to Bad Omen by consuming the new Ominous Bottle item

### **Raids**

-   Bad Omen no longer triggers a Raid directly when entering a Village
    -   Instead, it will transform into a Raid Omen variant with a duration of 30 seconds
    -   Once the Raid Omen expires, a Raid will start at the location the player gained the Raid Omen
    -   Like any other effect, players can drink a Bucket of Milk to clear the Raid Omen, preventing the Raid from starting

### **Ominous Trials**

-   A new Ominous Event that can be accessed by exploring a Trial Chamber while Bad Omen is active
-   This event will have players facing more powerful Ominous Trial Spawners, if they dare

### **Trial Omen**

-   A variant that Bad Omen can transform into
    -   This occurs when the player is within detection range of a Trial Spawner that is not Ominous
    -   The Trial Omen will have a duration of 15 minutes multiplied by the transformed Bad Omen's level
-   Players that have Trial Omen are surrounded by ominous particles

### **Ominous Trial Spawner**

-   A more powerful active phase of the Trial Spawner with unique challenges and rewards
    -   Provides a more challenging experience that combat-loving players can opt into for better rewards
-   If a Trial Spawner detects a player that has the Trial Omen effect, the spawner will become Ominous if:
    -   It is not in cooldown
    -   Or, it is in cooldown but was not Ominous during its last activation
        -   Making it Ominous this way will bypass the cooldown
-   While active, it will:
    -   Glow blue instead of orange
    -   Emit soul flames instead of normal flames
    -   Periodically spawn potions and projectiles on top of unsuspecting players and mobs
        -   Based on their location, spawners in an area will select a random set of projectiles to spawn
        -   These projectiles will always include a single type of Lingering Potion from a set of possible effects
-   The mobs it spawns are more powerful than usual:
    -   Mobs that can wear equipment will often spawn with enchanted weapons and armor
        -   The armor these mobs wear have Armor Trims applied from the Trial Chambers
        -   All 3 of the following armor enchantments are applied to each piece:
            -   Protection IV
            -   Projectile Protection IV
            -   Fire Protection IV
        -   Sword enchantments can be either of the two:
            -   Sharpness I
            -   Knockback I
        -   Bow enchantments can be either of the two:
            -   Power I
            -   Punch I
    -   Mobs that cannot wear equipment will instead be spawned at double the total mob count over the course of the challenge
        -   The spawners for these mobs will also have an additional mob out at once during its challenge
-   Becoming Ominous will despawn any existing mobs it spawned and reset its challenge
    -   If those mobs picked up or equipped any items on the floor, those items will be dropped when they despawn
    -   It will stay Ominous until it has been defeated and its cooldown has finished
-   When defeated, it will eject a different set of loot to normal Trial Spawners

### **Ominous Vault**

-   A variant of Vaults that have a more menacing looking and emit soul flames instead of normal flames
-   These hold a more valuable set of rewards than the standard Vaults that are unlocked by Trial Keys
-   Can be found throughout Trial Chambers in harder to reach places, and require an Ominous Trial Key to unlock

### **Ominous Trial Key**

-   A variant of the Trial Key which has a 30% chance to eject when defeating an Ominous Trial Spawner
-   Can be used to unlock Ominous Vaults

    -   Silverfish are immune to Infested
-   Whenever a mob with Oozing dies, it will check within a 5x5x5 area how many Slimes there are
