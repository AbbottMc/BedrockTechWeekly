## Add-Ons and Script Engine

-   The \[Beta\] fields in the "minecraft:looked\_at" and "minecraft:home" entity components are no longer marked as \[Beta\] and no longer require "use\_beta\_features" to be specified in the root JSON object


## **Script API**

<Switcher techSapi={<TechSapiStable/>} techSapiDiff={undefined}/>

## Audio

-   Per-biome ambient sounds are now defined in client\_biome JSON components
    
    -   This uses the new "minecraft:ambient\_sounds" component
    -   Named sounds must be defined in "individual\_named\_sounds" in sounds.json files

## Biomes

-   Client biome JSON files now support a "minecraft:biome\_music" component with a "volume\_multiplier" field which will gradually affect music volume when the audio listener is inside the corresponding biome
    
    -   The gradual volume change will take roughly ten seconds and will linearly increase but exponentially decrease

## Blocks

-   Updated `minecraft:destructible_by_mining` component, new field `item_specific_speeds` no longer experimental.
    
-   Removed the following vanilla block tags from experimental
    
    -   "minecraft:diamond\_tier\_destructible"
    -   "minecraft:iron\_tier\_destructible"
    -   "minecraft:is\_hatchet\_item\_destructible"
    -   "minecraft:is\_hoe\_item\_destructible"
    -   "minecraft:is\_mace\_item\_destructible"
    -   "minecraft:is\_pickaxe\_item\_destructible"
    -   "minecraft:is\_shears\_item\_destructible"
    -   "minecraft:is\_shovel\_item\_destructible"
    -   "minecraft:is\_sword\_item\_destructible"
    -   "minecraft:netherite\_tier\_destructible"
    -   "minecraft:stone\_tier\_destructible"
-   Renamed vanilla block tag "minecraft:is\_hatchet\_item\_destructible" to "minecraft:is\_axe\_item\_destructible".
    
-   Removed the following vanilla block tags.
    
    -   "minecraft:is\_digger\_item\_destructible"
    -   "minecraft:is\_tool\_item\_destructible"
    -   "minecraft:gold\_tier\_destructible"
    -   "minecraft:wood\_tier\_destructible"
-   Added the 'minecraft:liquid\_detection' component to the Upcoming Creator Features experiment, which controls the basic liquid detection properties of a block, such as liquidlogging, liquid blocking, and being broken or popped by liquid spread. The only liquid currently supported by the component is water.
    
-   Using the "minecraft:block\_placer" item component to render the referenced block as the item icon no longer requires the "Upcoming Creator Features" toggle
    

## Camera

-   The camera now rotates the correct way around the X and Y axes when using the /camera command

## Commands

-   The "mine" overload was added to the /loot command under the Upcoming Creator Features experiments
    
-   Added delay overload to the `Schedule` command, which allows you to queue a function to be executed after a certain amount of time. Time can be specified with no postfix, postfix 't' to indicate ticks, postfix 's' to indicate seconds, or with the postfix 'd' to indicate days. You can also give the argument 'append' to add your request to the queue no matter what, or 'replace' (which is also the default) to replace all current matching requests with the new one.
    
    -   `/schedule delay add \<function\> \<delay (ticks)\> [append|replace]`
    -   `/schedule delay clear \<function\>`
-   Translated rawtexts with extra percentage signs in them no longer expand inconsistently for numbered forms ("%%%%1"), compared to non-numbered ones ("%%%%s"). ([MCPE-171001](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-171001 "https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-171001"))
    
-   Effect command now properly displays duration as seconds in the displayed message after adding an effect ([MCPE-186963](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-186963 "https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-186963"))
    

## Editor (Beta)

-   Editor (Beta) is now available as part of Bedrock
-   Editor is an intuitive, visual tool to effortlessly build, refine, and share captivating Minecraft worlds at scale
-   To learn how to access Editor and the available tools please visit the [Editor Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/bedrockeditor/EditorInstallation?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/bedrockeditor/EditorInstallation?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable")

## Entity Components

-   Added new component 'minecraft:can\_attack\_ghast'. When added to an entity, it enables that entity to target and attack Ghasts
    
-   'behavior.summon\_entity' now lets creators specify an event to be invoked on the summoned entity immediately after summon ([MCPE-44454](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-44454 "https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-44454"))
    
-   Removed the 'minecraft:can\_attack\_ghast' component and replaced it with a new component 'minecraft:cannot\_be\_attacked'. When added to an entity it prevents other entities from attacking it unless they fulfill an exception filter, in vanilla it is added to Ghasts, creators can add their entities to the exception filter allowing them to then attack Ghasts
    
-   The "minecraft:looked\_at" component's "look\_at\_locations" field now accepts a list of objects as a parameter, each containing two fields
    
    -   "location", the location of the entity that must be visible
        -   Valid values: "head", "body", "feet"
    -   "vertical\_offset", an optional vertical offset applied to the entity's location
-   Added the 'minecraft:ignore\_cannot\_be\_attacked' component and moved the filter from 'minecraft:cannot\_be\_attacked' to it. This allows content to have custom mobs which bypass the 'cannot\_be\_attacked' component (for example the one on the Ghast) without requiring a modification of the attacked mob's settings
    

## Entity Event Responses

-   Added the "play\_sound" entity event response, which allows the owner entity to emit sounds
    
    -   The "sound" field specifies the sound event to play
    -   Sounds are played at the owner entity's position
-   The "execute\_event\_on\_home\_block" entity event response is now marked as \[Beta\] and requires "use\_beta\_features" to be specified in the root JSON object
    
    -   The current implementation doesn't fully align with our internal standards, so it will remain unavailable for Creator content until we can develop a more robust technical solution
    -   This approach allows us to iterate on the feature without risking backward compatibility
-   Added the "emit\_particle" entity event response, allowing particles to be emitted at the center of the entity's bounding box
    
    -   The "particle" field allows to specify the type of particle to emit

## General

-   Creating a new world from a template that supports random seeds will now clear any stored spawn position from the level data
    
-   Fixed issue that caused the export as template functionality to generate invalid mctemplate UUIDs

-   Moved `query.server_memory_tier` to stable.
    -   Removed 'Undetermined'. It returns a number representing the server RAM memory tier, 0 = 'SuperLow', 1 = 'Low', 2 = 'Mid', 3 = 'High', or 4 = 'SuperHigh'. Available on the server side (Behavior Packs) only.
-   Moved `query.client_max_render_distance` to stable.

## Creator Options

-   Added section "Device Info Settings".
    -   Added option to allow override memory tier used in Scripting and Molang.

## Molang

-   Added `query.last_input_mode_is_any`. It takes one or more arguments ('keyboard\_and\_mouse', 'touch', 'gamepad', or 'motion\_controller'). If the last input used is any of the specified string values, returns 1.0. Otherwise returns 0.0. Available on the Client (Resource Packs) only. Added `query.touch_only_affects_hotbar`. It returns 1.0 if the touch input only affects the touchbar, otherwise returns 0.0. Available on the Client (Resource Packs) only.

    -   Creators will be able to modify structure generation rules around placement (location and frequency), layout (how structure pieces are placed relative to one another), and customization (how blocks within a structure piece are modified or replaced).
    -   There are 4 new JSON files comprising Jigsaw Structure data:
        -   Jigsaw Structures: These are structures that can be constructed throughout the world with various structure pieces. The connection block is a jigsaw block.
        -   Processors: A processor can add custom behaviors to the structure that affects how it looks.
        -   Structure Sets: Structure sets are JSON that indicate where and how a structure is placed throughout the world.
