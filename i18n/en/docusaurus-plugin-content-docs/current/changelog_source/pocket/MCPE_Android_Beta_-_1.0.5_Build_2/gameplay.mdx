## **Important Note:** If you are participating in the 1.0.5 Beta, you will not have access to MCPE/Win10 Realms while you are in the Beta. To get access back to your Realm, you will need to opt-out of the Beta and revert to the 1.0.4 build.

If you find any bugs, be sure to report them here! Click here to give us feedback because we need your thoughts on what you think about this update! As this Beta is for Android only, some of the features & fixes may not apply as they are for other versions but it will give something for those players to look for in future updates.

Also, we advise all of our beta players to make back-ups of their saved games before running them on new beta builds.
