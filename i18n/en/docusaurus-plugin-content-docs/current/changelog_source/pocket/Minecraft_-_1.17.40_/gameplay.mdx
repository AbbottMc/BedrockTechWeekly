## **Experimental Features:**

## **Reminder:** We are still tweaking world generation and features may change. Please remember to **make regular backup copies** of your favourite worlds!

Please keep in mind that these features are work in progress, still under in development, and subject to change. If you activate them, your world might crash, break, or not work with future updates. Experimental features cannot be turned off after world creation.

For more information, please see the article about enabling experimental features at [aka.ms/MCExperimentalFeatures](https://aka.ms/MCExperimentalFeatures).
