## **Experimental Gameplay:**  
A handful of features from Update Aquatic have been added to the beta via Experimental Gameplay. These features are incomplete and are not representative of final gameplay but feedback is absolutely welcome! These are also not all of the Update Aquatic features coming to Minecraft and more is on the way.  
  
'Use Experimental Gameplay' can be toggled in World Settings. This may break your world so a copy of your world will be created with ""\[EX\]"" before the world name. This feature cannot be disabled once it is enabled for a world and any progress will not be saved to the original world.
