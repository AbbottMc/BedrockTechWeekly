Q: The Oculus launcher is telling me that launching Minecraft ""failed""?

A: Check to make sure you aren't already running Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition Beta. If you are, make sure you close the app first before trying to play it from the Oculus launcher. If you continue to have problems, try running Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition Beta by playing it from the Xbox app. This may give you more insight into why the game won't play.

Q: The Oculus launcher is reporting a signature issue with the 2015.3 x86 redist DLLs.

OR The Oculus launcher is crashing and my primary language files aren't English.

A: Good news- we pushed out a fix that should resolve both of these issues. Just restart your Oculus store and accept the update that you should see waiting for you in Minecraft.

Q: I am seeing strange graphics issues when I try to play the game.

A: Make certain your graphics drivers are up-to-date. If you have an Nvidia graphics card, you may need to manually visit the Nvidia website to get the most up-to-date drivers for your graphics card. Download, install the new drivers, and then restart your computer using the restart option from the power menu.

Q: I have dual graphics cards and multiple monitors. I can hear the Minecraft music but Minecraft is stuck on a white screen with 'Please wait'.

A: This may be due to some confusion between your graphics cards regarding HDMI input and the Rift. If you have HDMI inputs going into both cards, unplug the HDMI input that is not associated with the Oculus Rift.
